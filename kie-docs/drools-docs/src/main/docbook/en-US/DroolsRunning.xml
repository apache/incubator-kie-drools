    <section>
      <title>EntryPoint</title>

      <para>The <code>EntryPoint</code> provides the methods
      around inserting, updating and retrieving facts. The term "entry point"
      is related to the fact that we have multiple partitions in a Working
      Memory and you can choose which one you are inserting into, although
      this use case is aimed at event processing and covered in more detail in
      the Fusion manual. Most rule based applications will work with the
      default entry point alone.</para>

      <para>The <code>KieRuntime</code> interface provides the main
      interaction with the engine. It is available in rule consequences and
      process actions. In this manual the focus is on the methods and
      interfaces related to rules, and the methods pertaining to processes
      will be ignored for now. But you'll notice that the
      <code>KieRuntime</code> inherits methods from both the
      <code>WorkingMemory</code> and the <code>ProcessRuntime</code>, thereby
      providing a unified API to work with processes and rules. When working
      with rules, three interfaces form the <code>KieRuntime</code>:
      <code>EntryPoint</code>, <code>WorkingMemory</code> and the
      <code>KieRuntime</code> itself.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Insertion</title>

        <para>Insertion is the act of telling the <code>WorkingMemory</code>
        about a fact, which you do by <code>ksession.insert(yourObject)</code>,
        for example. When a fact is inserted it is not immediately examined for
        matches against the rules. This means that <emphasis>all</emphasis> of
        the work for deciding about firing or not firing a rule is done lazily
        when <code>fireAllRules()</code> is invoked. Expert systems typically use the term
        <emphasis>assert</emphasis> or <emphasis>assertion</emphasis> to refer
        to facts made available to the system. However, due to "assert" being
        a keyword in most languages, we have decided to use the
        <literal>insert</literal> keyword; however, expect to hear the two terms
        used interchangeably.</para>

        <!-- FIXME - I think we might want to add this sentence to the previous paragraph.
        However, when the rules are executed, they can assert new objects
        thus causing new work to be needed. laune: No, it should be elsewhere.
      -->

        <para>When an Object is inserted it returns a <code>FactHandle</code>.
        This <code>FactHandle</code> is the token used to represent your
        inserted object within the <code>WorkingMemory</code>. It is also used
        for interactions with the <code>WorkingMemory</code> when you wish to
        delete or modify an object.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = ksession.insert( stilton );      </programlisting>

        <para>As mentioned in the KieBase section, a Working Memory may
        operate in two assertion modes, i.e., equality or identity, with
        identity being the default.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Identity</emphasis> means that the Working Memory uses
        an <code>IdentityHashMap</code> to store all asserted objects. New
        instance assertions always result in the return of new
        <code>FactHandle</code>, but if an instance is asserted again then it
        returns the original fact handle, i.e., it ignores repeated insertions
        for the same object.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Equality</emphasis> means that the Working Memory uses
        a <code>HashMap</code> to store all asserted objects. An object instance
        assertion will only return a new <code>FactHandle</code> if the inserted
        object is not equal (according to its <code>equal</code> method) to an
        already existing fact.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Deletion</title>

        <para>Deletion is the removal of a fact from Working Memory, which
        means that it will no longer track and match that fact, and any rules
        that are activated and dependent on that fact will be cancelled. Note
        that it is possible to have rules that depend on the nonexistence of a
        fact, in which case deleting a fact may cause a rule to activate.
        (See the <code>not</code> and <code>exists</code> keywords.) Deletion
        may be done using the <code>FactHandle</code> that was returned by the
        insert call. On the right hand side of a rule the
        <literal>delete</literal> statement is used, which works with a simple
        object reference.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = ksession.insert( stilton );
....
ksession.delete( stiltonHandle );            </programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Update</title>

        <para>The Rule Engine must be notified of modified facts, so that they
        can be reprocessed. You must use the <code>update()</code> method to
        notify the <code>WorkingMemory</code> of changed objects for those
        objects that are not able to notify the <code>WorkingMemory</code>
        themselves. Notice that <code>update()</code> always takes the
        modified object as a second parameter, which allows you to specify new
        instances for immutable objects. On the right hand side of a rule the
        <code>modify</code> statement is recommended, as it makes the
        changes and notifies the engine in a single statement. Alternatively,
        after changing a fact object's field values through calls of setter
        methods you must invoke <code>update</code> immediately, event
        before changing another fact, or you will cause problems with the
        indexing within the rule engine. The modify statement avoids this
        problem.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = workingMemory.insert( stilton );
...
stilton.setPrice( 100 );
workingMemory.update( stiltonHandle, stilton );              </programlisting>

      <para>The RuleRuntime provides access to the Agenda, permits query
      executions, and lets you access named Entry Points.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Query</title>

        <para>Queries are used to retrieve fact sets based on patterns, as
        they are used in rules. Patterns may make use of optional parameters.
        Queries can be defined in the Knowledge Base, from where they are
        called up to return the matching results. While iterating over the
        result collection, any identifier bound in the query can be used to
        access the corresponding fact or fact field by calling the
        <code>get</code> method with the binding variable's name as its
        argument. If the binding refers to a fact object, its FactHandle can
        be retrieved by calling <code>getFactHandle</code>, again with the
        variable's name as the parameter.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Live Queries</title>

        <para>Invoking queries and processing the results by iterating over
        the returned set is not a good way to monitor changes over
        time.</para>

        <para>To alleviate this, Drools provides Live Queries, which have a
        listener attached instead of returning an iterable result set. These
        live queries stay open by creating a view and publishing change events for
        the contents of this view. To activate, you start your query with
        parameters and listen to changes in the resulting view. The
        <code>dispose</code> method terminates the query and discontinues this
        reactive scenario.</para>

        <example>
          <title>Implementing ViewChangedEventListener</title>

          <programlisting language="java">final List updated = new ArrayList();
final List removed = new ArrayList();
final List added = new ArrayList();

ViewChangedEventListener listener = new ViewChangedEventListener() {
 public void rowUpdated(Row row) {
  updated.add( row.get( "$price" ) );
 }

 public void rowRemoved(Row row) {
  removed.add( row.get( "$price" ) );
 }

 public void rowAdded(Row row) {
  added.add( row.get( "$price" ) );
 }
};

// Open the LiveQuery
LiveQuery query = ksession.openLiveQuery( "cheeses",
                                          new Object[] { "cheddar", "stilton" },
                                          listener );
...
...
query.dispose() // calling dispose to terminate the live query</programlisting>

        <para><code>AgendaFilter</code> objects are optional implementations
        of the filter interface which are used to allow or deny the firing of
        a match. What you filter on is entirely up to the
        implementation. Drools 4.0 used to supply some out of the box filters,
        which have not be exposed in drools 5.0 knowledge-api, but they are
        simple to implement and the Drools 4.0 code base can be referred
        to.</para>

        <para>To use a filter specify it while calling
        <code>fireAllRules()</code>. The following example permits only rules
        ending in the string <code>"Test"</code>. All others will be filtered
        out.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Agenda</title>

    <para>The Agenda is a <emphasis>Rete</emphasis> feature. During actions on
    the <code>WorkingMemory</code>, rules may become fully matched and
    eligible for execution; a single Working Memory Action can result in
    multiple eligible rules. When a rule is fully matched a Match is
    created, referencing the rule and the matched facts, and placed onto the
    Agenda. The Agenda controls the execution order of these Matches using
    a Conflict Resolution strategy.</para>

    <para>The engine cycles repeatedly through two phases:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Working Memory Actions. This is where most of the work takes
        place, either in the Consequence (the RHS itself) or the main Java
        application process. Once the Consequence has finished or the main
        Java application process calls <code>fireAllRules()</code> the engine
        switches to the Agenda Evaluation phase.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Agenda Evaluation. This attempts to select a rule to fire. If no
        rule is found it exits, otherwise it fires the found rule, switching
        the phase back to Working Memory Actions.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <figure>
      <title>Two Phase Execution</title>

      <mediaobject>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The process repeats until the agenda is clear, in which case control
    returns to the calling application. When Working Memory Actions are taking
    place, no rules are being fired.</para>

    </figure>

    <section>
      <title>Conflict Resolution</title>

      <para>Conflict resolution is required when there are multiple rules on
      the agenda. (The basics to this are covered in chapter "Quick Start".)
      As firing a rule may have side effects on the working memory, the rule
      engine needs to know in what order the rules should fire (for instance,
      firing ruleA may cause ruleB to be removed from the agenda).</para>

      <para>The default conflict resolution strategies employed by Drools are:
      Salience and LIFO (last in, first out).</para>

      <para>The most visible one is <emphasis>salience</emphasis> (or
      priority), in which case a user can specify that a certain rule has a
      higher priority (by giving it a higher number) than other rules. In that
      case, the rule with higher salience will be preferred. LIFO priorities
      are based on the assigned Working Memory Action counter value, with all
      rules created during the same action receiving the same value. The
      execution order of a set of firings with the same priority value is
      arbitrary.</para>

      <para>As a general rule, it is a good idea not to count on rules firing
      in any particular order, and to author the rules without worrying about
      a "flow". However when a flow is needed a number of possibilities exist,
      including but not limited to: agenda groups, rule flow groups,
      activation groups, control/semaphore facts. These are discussed in later
      sections.</para>

      <para>Drools 4.0 supported custom conflict resolution strategies; while
      this capability still exists in Drools it has not yet been exposed to
      the end user via knowledge-api in Drools 5.0.</para>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Agenda groups are a way to partition rules (matches, actually)
      on the agenda. At any one time, only one group has "focus" which means
      that matches for rules in that group only will take effect. You can
      also have rules with "auto focus" which means that the focus is taken
      for its agenda group when that rule's conditions are true.</para>

      <para>Agenda groups are known as "modules" in CLIPS terminology. While
      it best to design rules that do not need control flow, this is not
      always possible. Agenda groups provide a handy way to create a "flow"
      between grouped rules. You can switch the group which has focus either
      from within the rule engine, or via the API. If your rules have a clear
      need for multiple "phases" or "sequences" of processing, consider using
      agenda-groups for this purpose.</para>

      <para>Each time <code>setFocus()</code> is called it pushes that Agenda
      Group onto a stack. When the focus group is empty it is popped from the
      stack and the focus group that is now on top evaluates. An Agenda Group
      can appear in multiple locations on the stack. The default Agenda Group
      is "MAIN", with all rules which do not specify an Agenda Group being in
      this group. It is also always the first group on the stack, given focus
      initially, by default.</para>

      <para>An activation group is a set of rules bound together by the same
      "activation-group" rule attribute. In this group only one rule can fire,
      and after that rule has fired all the other rules are cancelled from the
      agenda. The <code>clear()</code> method can be called at any time, which
      cancels all of the activations before one has had a chance to
      fire.</para>

      <para>A rule flow group is a group of rules associated by the

      group is activate. The group itself can only become active when the
      elaboration of the ruleflow diagram reaches the node representing the
      group. Here too, the <code>clear()</code> method can be called at any
      time to cancels all matches still remaining on the Agenda.</para>

    <title>Event Model</title>

    <para>The event package provides means to be notified of rule engine
    events, including rules firing, objects being asserted, etc. This allows
    you, for instance, to separate logging and auditing activities from the
    main part of your application (and the rules).</para>

    <para>The <code>WorkingMemoryEventManager</code> allows for listeners to be added and removed,
      so that events for the working memory and the agenda can be listened to.</para>

    <para>The following code snippet shows how a simple agenda listener is
    declared and attached to a session. It will print matches after they
    have fired.</para>

});     </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Drools also provides <code>DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener</code>
    and <code>DebugAgendaEventListener</code> which implement each method with
    a debug print statement. To print all Working Memory events, you add a
    listener like this:</para>

    <title>StatelessKieSession</title>

    <para>The <code>StatelessKieSession</code> wraps the
    <code>KieSession</code>, instead of extending it. Its main
    focus is on decision service type scenarios. It avoids the need to call
    <code>dispose()</code>. Stateless sessions do not support iterative
    insertions and the method call <code>fireAllRules()</code> from Java code;
    the act of calling <code>execute()</code> is a single-shot method that
    will internally instantiate a <code>KieSession</code>, add
    all the user data and execute user commands, call
    <code>fireAllRules()</code>, and then call <code>dispose()</code>. While
    the main way to work with this class is via the
    <code>BatchExecution</code> (a subinterface of <code>Command</code>) as
    supported by the <code>CommandExecutor</code> interface, two convenience
    methods are provided for when simple object insertion is all that's
    required. The <code>CommandExecutor</code> and <code>BatchExecution</code>
    are talked about in detail in their own section.</para>

          <imagedata fileref="images/ApiReference/StatelessKieSession.png"
                     format=""/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Our simple example shows a stateless session executing a given
    collection of Java objects using the convenience API. It will iterate the
    collection, inserting each element in turn.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Simple StatelessKieSession execution with a Collection</title>

      <programlisting language="java">StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession();
ksession.execute( collection );</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>If this was done as a single Command it would be as follows:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Simple StatelessKieSession execution with InsertElements Command</title>

      <programlisting language="java">ksession.execute( CommandFactory.newInsertElements( collection ) );  </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>If you wanted to insert the collection itself, and the collection's
    individual elements, then
    <code>CommandFactory.newInsert(collection)</code> would do the job.</para>

    <para>Methods of the <code>CommandFactory</code> create the supported
    commands, all of which can be marshalled using XStream and the
    <code>BatchExecutionHelper</code>. <code>BatchExecutionHelper</code>
    provides details on the XML format as well as how to use Drools Pipeline
    to automate the marshalling of <code>BatchExecution</code> and
    <code>ExecutionResults</code>.</para>

    <para><code>StatelessKieSession</code> supports globals, scoped in a
    number of ways. I'll cover the non-command way first, as commands are
    scoped to a specific execution call. Globals can be resolved in three
    ways.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The StatelessKieSession method <code>getGlobals()</code>
        returns a Globals instance which provides access to the session's
        globals. These are shared for <emphasis>all</emphasis> execution
        calls. Exercise caution regarding mutable globals because execution
        calls can be executing simultaneously in different threads.</para>

        <example>
          <title>Session scoped global</title>

          <programlisting language="java">StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession();
// Set a global hbnSession, that can be used for DB interactions in the rules.
ksession.setGlobal( "hbnSession", hibernateSession );
// Execute while being able to resolve the "hbnSession" identifier.
ksession.execute( collection ); </programlisting>
        </example>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Using a delegate is another way of global resolution. Assigning
        a value to a global (with <code>setGlobal(String, Object)</code>)
        results in the value being stored in an internal collection mapping
        identifiers to values. Identifiers in this internal collection will
        have priority over any supplied delegate. Only if an identifier cannot
        be found in this internal collection, the delegate global (if any)
        will be used.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The third way of resolving globals is to have execution scoped
        globals. Here, a <code>Command</code> to set a global is passed to the
        <code>CommandExecutor</code>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <code>CommandExecutor</code> interface also offers the ability
    to export data via "out" parameters. Inserted facts, globals and query
    results can all be returned.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Out identifiers</title>

      <programlisting language="java">// Set up a list of commands
List cmds = new ArrayList();
cmds.add( CommandFactory.newSetGlobal( "list1", new ArrayList(), true ) );
cmds.add( CommandFactory.newInsert( new Person( "jon", 102 ), "person" ) );
cmds.add( CommandFactory.newQuery( "Get People" "getPeople" );

// Execute the list
ExecutionResults results =
  ksession.execute( CommandFactory.newBatchExecution( cmds ) );

// Retrieve the ArrayList
results.getValue( "list1" );
// Retrieve the inserted Person fact
results.getValue( "person" );
// Retrieve the query as a QueryResults instance.
results.getValue( "Get People" );</programlisting>
    </example>

    <section>
      <title>Sequential Mode</title>

      <para>With Rete you have a stateful session where objects can be
      asserted and modified over time, and where rules can also be added and
      removed. Now what happens if we assume a stateless session, where after
      the initial data set no more data can be asserted or modified and rules
      cannot be added or removed? Certainly it won't be necessary to
      re-evaluate rules, and the engine will be able to operate in a
      simplified way.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Order the Rules by salience and position in the ruleset (by
          setting a sequence attribute on the rule terminal node).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Create an elements, one element for each possible rule
          match; element position indicates firing order.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Turn off all node memories, except the right-input Object
          memory.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Disconnect the Left Input Adapter Node propagation, and let
          the Object plus the Node be referenced in a Command object, which is
          added to a list on the Working Memory for later execution.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Assert all objects, and, when all assertions are finished and
          thus right-input node memories are populated, check the Command list
          and execute each in turn.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All resulting Matches should be placed in the elements, based
          upon the determined sequence number of the Rule. Record the first
          and last populated elements, to reduce the iteration range.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Iterate the elements of Matches, executing populated element
          in turn.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If we have a maximum number of allowed rule executions, we can
          exit our network evaluations early to fire all the rules in the
          elements.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The <code>LeftInputAdapterNode</code> no longer creates a Tuple,
      adding the Object, and then propagate the Tuple – instead a Command
      object is created and added to a list in the Working Memory. This
      Command object holds a reference to the
      <code>LeftInputAdapterNode</code> and the propagated object. This stops
      any left-input propagations at insertion time, so that we know that a
      right-input propagation will never need to attempt a join with the
      left-inputs (removing the need for left-input memory). All nodes have
      their memory turned off, including the left-input Tuple memory but
      excluding the right-input object memory, which means that the only node
      remembering an insertion propagation is the right-input object memory.
      Once all the assertions are finished and all right-input memories
      populated, we can then iterate the list of
      <code>LeftInputAdatperNode</code> Command objects calling each in turn.
      They will propagate down the network attempting to join with the
      right-input objects, but they won't be remembered in the left input as
      we know there will be no further object assertions and thus propagations
      into the right-input memory.</para>

      <para>There is no longer an Agenda, with a priority queue to schedule
      the Tuples; instead, there is simply an elements for the number of rules.
      The sequence number of the <code>RuleTerminalNode</code> indicates the
      element within the elements where to place the Match. Once all Command
      objects have finished we can iterate our elements, checking each element in
      turn, and firing the Matches if they exist. To improve performance,
      we remember the first and the last populated cell in the elements. The
      network is constructed, with each <code>RuleTerminalNode</code> being
      given a sequence number based on a salience number and its order of
      being added to the network.</para>

      <para>Typically the right-input node memories are Hash Maps, for fast
      object deletion; here, as we know there will be no object deletions,
      we can use a list when the values of the object are not indexed. For
      larger numbers of objects indexed Hash Maps provide a performance
      increase; if we know an object type has only a few instances, indexing
      is probably not advantageous, and a list can be used.</para>

      <para>Sequential mode can only be used with a Stateless Session and is
      off by default. To turn it on, either call
      <code>RuleBaseConfiguration.setSequential(true)</code>, or set the
      rulebase configuration property <code>drools.sequential</code> to true.
      Sequential mode can fall back to a dynamic agenda by calling
      <code>setSequentialAgenda</code> with
      <code>SequentialAgenda.DYNAMIC</code>. You may also set the
      "drools.sequential.agenda" property to "sequential" or "dynamic".</para>

  <section>
    <title>Commands and the CommandExecutor</title>

    <para>The <code>CommandFactory</code> allows for commands to be executed
    on those sessions, the only difference being that the Stateless Knowledge
    Session executes <code>fireAllRules()</code> at the end before disposing
    the session. The currently supported commands are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>FireAllRules</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>GetGlobal</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>SetGlobal</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>InsertObject</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>InsertElements</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Query</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>StartProcess</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>BatchExecution</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para><code>InsertObject</code> will insert a single object, with an
    optional "out" identifier. <code>InsertElements</code> will iterate an
    Iterable, inserting each of the elements. What this means is that a
    Stateless Knowledge Session is no longer limited to just inserting
    objects, it can now start processes or execute queries, and do this in any
    order.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Insert Command</title>

      <programlisting language="java">StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession();
ExecutionResults bresults =
  ksession.execute( CommandFactory.newInsert( new Cheese( "stilton" ), "stilton_id" ) );
Stilton stilton = bresults.getValue( "stilton_id" );
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The execute method always returns an <code>ExecutionResults</code>
    instance, which allows access to any command results if they specify an
    out identifier such as the "stilton_id" above.</para>

    <example>
      <title>InsertElements Command</title>

      <programlisting language="java">StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession();
Command cmd = CommandFactory.newInsertElements( Arrays.asList( Object[] {
                  new Cheese( "stilton" ),
                  new Cheese( "brie" ),
                  new Cheese( "cheddar" ),
              });
ExecutionResults bresults = ksession.execute( cmd );
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The execute method only allows for a single command. That's where
    <code>BatchExecution</code> comes in, which represents a composite
    command, created from a list of commands. Now, execute will iterate over
    the list and execute each command in turn. This means you can insert some
    objects, start a process, call fireAllRules and execute a query, all in a
    single <code>execute(...)</code> call, which is quite powerful.</para>

    <para>As mentioned previosly, the StatelessKieSession will execute
    <code>fireAllRules()</code> automatically at the end. However the
    keen-eyed reader probably has already noticed the
    <code>FireAllRules</code> command and wondered how that works with a
    StatelessKieSession. The <code>FireAllRules</code> command is
    allowed, and using it will disable the automatic execution at the end;
    think of using it as a sort of manual override function.</para>

    <para>A custom XStream marshaller can be used with the Drools Pipeline to
    achieve XML scripting, which is perfect for services. Here are two simple
    XML samples, one for the BatchExecution and one for the
    <code>ExecutionResults</code>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Simple BatchExecution XML</title>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;batch-execution&gt;
   &lt;insert out-identifier='outStilton'&gt;
      &lt;org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
         &lt;type&gt;stilton&lt;/type&gt;
         &lt;price&gt;25&lt;/price&gt;
         &lt;oldPrice&gt;0&lt;/oldPrice&gt;
      &lt;/org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
   &lt;/insert&gt;
&lt;/batch-execution&gt;
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <example>
      <title>Simple ExecutionResults XML</title>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;execution-results&gt;
   &lt;result identifier='outStilton'&gt;
      &lt;org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
         &lt;type&gt;stilton&lt;/type&gt;
         &lt;oldPrice&gt;25&lt;/oldPrice&gt;
         &lt;price&gt;30&lt;/price&gt;
      &lt;/org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
   &lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/execution-results&gt;
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Spring and Camel, covered in the integrations book, facilitate
    declarative services.</para>

    <example>
      <title>BatchExecution Marshalled to XML</title>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;batch-execution&gt;
  &lt;insert out-identifier="stilton"&gt;
    &lt;org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;stilton&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;price&gt;1&lt;/price&gt;
      &lt;oldPrice&gt;0&lt;/oldPrice&gt;
    &lt;/org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
  &lt;/insert&gt;
  &lt;query out-identifier='cheeses2' name='cheesesWithParams'&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;stilton&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;cheddar&lt;/string&gt;
  &lt;/query&gt;
&lt;/batch-execution&gt;
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The <code>CommandExecutor</code> returns an
    <code>ExecutionResults</code>, and this is handled by the pipeline code
    snippet as well. A similar output for the &lt;batch-execution&gt; XML
    sample above would be:</para>

    <example>
      <title>ExecutionResults Marshalled to XML</title>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;execution-results&gt;
  &lt;result identifier="stilton"&gt;
    &lt;org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;stilton&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;price&gt;2&lt;/price&gt;
    &lt;/org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
  &lt;/result&gt;
  &lt;result identifier='cheeses2'&gt;
    &lt;query-results&gt;
      &lt;identifiers&gt;
        &lt;identifier&gt;cheese&lt;/identifier&gt;
      &lt;/identifiers&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;cheddar&lt;/type&gt;
          &lt;price&gt;2&lt;/price&gt;
          &lt;oldPrice&gt;0&lt;/oldPrice&gt;
        &lt;/org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;cheddar&lt;/type&gt;
          &lt;price&gt;1&lt;/price&gt;
          &lt;oldPrice&gt;0&lt;/oldPrice&gt;
        &lt;/org.drools.compiler.Cheese&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/query-results&gt;
  &lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/execution-results&gt;
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The <code>BatchExecutionHelper</code> provides a configured XStream
    instance to support the marshalling of Batch Executions, where the
    resulting XML can be used as a message format, as shown above. Configured
    converters only exist for the commands supported via the Command Factory.
    The user may add other converters for their user objects. This is very
    useful for scripting stateless or stateful knowledge sessions, especially
    when services are involved.</para>

    <para>There is currently no XML schema to support schema validation. The
    basic format is outlined here, and the drools-pipeline module has an
    illustrative unit test in the <code>XStreamBatchExecutionTest</code> unit
    test. The root element is &lt;batch-execution&gt; and it can contain zero
    or more commands elements.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Root XML element</title>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;batch-execution&gt;
...
&lt;/batch-execution&gt;
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>This contains a list of elements that represent commands, the
    supported commands is limited to those Commands provided by the Command
    Factory. The most basic of these is the &lt;insert&gt; element, which
    inserts objects. The contents of the insert element is the user object, as
    dictated by XStream.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Insert</title>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;batch-execution&gt;
   &lt;insert&gt;
      ...&lt;!-- any user object --&gt;
   &lt;/insert&gt;
&lt;/batch-execution&gt;
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The insert element features an "out-identifier" attribute, demanding
    that the inserted object will also be returned as part of the result
    payload.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Insert with Out Identifier Command</title>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;batch-execution&gt;
   &lt;insert out-identifier='userVar'&gt;
      ...
   &lt;/insert&gt;
&lt;/batch-execution&gt;
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>It's also possible to insert a collection of objects using the
    &lt;insert-elements&gt; element. This command does not support an
    out-identifier. The <code>org.domain.UserClass</code> is just an
    illustrative user object that XStream would serialize.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Insert Elements command</title>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;batch-execution&gt;
   &lt;insert-elements&gt;
      &lt;org.domain.UserClass&gt;
         ...
      &lt;/org.domain.UserClass&gt;
      &lt;org.domain.UserClass&gt;
         ...
      &lt;/org.domain.UserClass&gt;
      &lt;org.domain.UserClass&gt;
         ...
      &lt;/org.domain.UserClass&gt;
   &lt;/insert-elements&gt;
&lt;/batch-execution&gt;
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>While the <literal>out</literal> attribute is useful in returning
    specific instances as a result payload, we often wish to run actual
    queries. Both parameter and parameterless queries are supported. The
    <literal>name</literal> attribute is the name of the query to be called,
    and the <literal>out-identifier</literal> is the identifier to be used for
    the query results in the <code>&lt;execution-results&gt;</code>
    payload.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Query Command</title>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;batch-execution&gt;
   &lt;query out-identifier='cheeses' name='cheeses'/&gt;
   &lt;query out-identifier='cheeses2' name='cheesesWithParams'&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;stilton&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;cheddar&lt;/string&gt;
   &lt;/query&gt;
&lt;/batch-execution&gt;
</programlisting>
    </example>
