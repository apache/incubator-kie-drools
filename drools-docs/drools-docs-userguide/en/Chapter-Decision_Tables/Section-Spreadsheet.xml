  <title>Decision tables in spreadsheets</title>

  <para>Decision tables are a "precise yet compact" (ref. Wikipedia) way of
  representing conditional logic, and are well suited to "business" level
  rules.</para>

  <para>Drools supports managing rules in a Spreadsheet format. Formats
  supported are Excel, and CSV. Thus you can use a variety of spreadsheet
  programs (such as Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org Calc amongst others). It
  is expected that web based decision table editors will be included in a near
  future release.</para>

  <para>Decision tables are an old concept (in software terms) but have proven
  useful over the years. Very briefly speaking, in Drools decision tables are
  a way to generate rules driven from the data entered into a spreadsheet. All
  the usual features of a spreadsheet for data capture and manipulation can be
  taken advantage of.</para>

  <section>
    <title>When to use Decision tables</title>

    <para>You may want to consider decision tables if you have rules that can
    be expressed as rule templates + data. In each row of a decision table,
    data is collected that is combined with the templates to generate a
    rule.</para>

    <para>Many businesses already use spreadsheets for managing data,
    calculations etc. If you are happy to continue this way, you can also
    manage your business rules this way. This also assumes you are happy to
    manage packages of rules in .xls or .csv files. Decision tables are not
    recommenced for rules that do not follow a set of templates, or where
    there are a small number of rules (or if you don't want to use software
    like excel or open office). They are ideal in the sense that you can
    control what "parameters" of rules can be edited, without exposing the
    rules directly.</para>

    <para>Decision tables also provide a degree of insulation from the
    underlying object model.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Here are some examples of real world decision tables (slightly
    edited to protect the innocent).</para>

    </screenshot>

    <para>In the above examples, the technical aspects of the decision table
    have been collapsed away (standard spreadsheet feature).</para>

    <para>The rules start from row 17 (each row results in a rule). The
    conditions are in column C, D, E etc.. (off screen are the actions). You
    can see that the value in the cells are quite simple, and have meaning
    when you look at the headers in Row 16. Column B is just a description. It
    is conventional to use color to make it obvious what the different areas
    of the table mean.</para>

    <para>Note that although the decision tables look like they process top
    down, this is not necessarily the case. It is ideal if you can author
    rules in such a way as order does not matter (simply as it makes
    maintenance easier, you are not trying to shift rows around all the time).
    As each row is a rule, the same principles apply. As the rule engine
    processes the facts, any rules that match may fire (some people are
    confused by this - it is possible to clear the agenda when a rule fires
    and simulate a very simple decision table where the first match exists).
    Also note that you can have multiple tables on the one spreadsheet (so
    rules can be grouped where they share common templates - yet at the end of
    the day they are all combined into a one rule package). Decision tables
    are essentially a tool to generate DRL rules automatically.</para>

    <title>How decision tables work</title>

    <para>The key point to keep in mind is that in a decision table, each row
    is a rule, and each column in that row is either a condition or action for
    that rule.</para>

    <screenshot>
      <screeninfo>Rows and columns</screeninfo>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="row_col.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>

    <para>The spreadsheet looks for the "RuleTable" keyword to indicate the
    start of a rule table (both the starting row and column). Other keywords
    are also used to define other package level attributes (covered later). It
    is important to keep the keywords in the one column. By convention the
    second column ("B") is used for this, but it can be any column (convention
    is to leave a margin on the left for notes). In the following diagram, C
    is actually the column where it starts. Everything to the left of this is
    ignored.</para>

    <para>If we expand the hidden sections, it starts to make more sense how
    it works. Note the keywords in column C.</para>

    <screenshot>
      <screeninfo>Expanded for rule templates</screeninfo>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="expanded.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>

    <para>Now you can see the hidden magic that makes it work. The RuleSet
    keyword indicates the name to be used in the "rule package" that all the
    rules will come under (the name is optional, it will have a default but
    you MUST have the "RuleSet" keyword) in the cell immediately to the right.
    The other keywords visible in Column C are: Import, Sequential which will
    be covered later - just note that in general the keywords make up
    name/value pairs. The RuleTable keyword is important as it indicates that
    a chunk of rules will follow, based on some rule templates. After the
    RuleTable keyword there is a name - this name is used to prefix the
    generated rules names (the row numbers are appended to create unique rule
    names). The column of RuleTable indicates the column in which the rules
    start (columns to the left are ignored).</para>

    <para>Referring to row 14 (the row immediately after RuleTable): the
    keywords CONDITION and ACTION indicate that the data in the columns below
    are for either the LHS or the RHS parts of a rule. There are other
    attributes on the rule which can also be optionally set this way.</para>

    <para>Row 15 contains declarations of "ObjectTypes" - the content in this
    row is optional (if you are not using it, you must leave a blank row - but
    you *will* want to use it !). When you use this row, the values in the
    cells below (row 16) become constraints on that object type. In the above
    case, it will generate: Person(age=="42") etc (where 42 comes from row
    18). In the above example, the "==" is implicit (if you just put a field
    name, it will assume that you are looking for exact matches). Also note
    that you can have an ObjectType declaration span columns (via merged cells)
    - and that means that all columns below the merged range will be combined
    into the one set of constraints.</para>

    <para>Row 16 contains the rule templates themselves: note that they can
    use the "$para" place holder to indicate where data from the cells below
    will be populated (you can use $param, or $1, $2 etc to indicate
    parameters from a comma separated list in a cell below). Row 17 is ignored
    - it is textual descriptions of the rule template.</para>

    <para>Row 18 to 19 shows data, which will be combined (interpolated) with
    the templates in row 15, to generate rules. If a cell contains no data,
    then its template is ignored (eg it means that condition, or action, does
    not apply for that rule-row). Rule rows are read until there is a BLANK
    row. You can have multiple RuleTables in a sheet. Row 20 contains another
    keyword, and a value - the row positions of keywords like this do not
    matter (most people put them at the top) but their column should be the
    same one where the RuleTable or RuleSet keywords should appear (in this
    case column C has been chosen to be significant, but you can use column A
    if you like).</para>

    <para>In the above example, rules would be rendered like the following (as
    it uses the "ObjectType" row): <programlisting>//row 18
rule "Cheese_fans_18"
  when
    Person(age=="42")
    Cheese(type=="stilton")
  then
    list.add("Old man stilton");
end

</programlisting> Note that the [age=="42"] and [type=="stilton"] are
    interpreted as single constraints to be added to the respective ObjectType
    in the cell above (if the cells above were spanned, then there could be
    multiple constraints on one "column".</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Keywords and syntax</title>

    <section>
      <title>Syntax of templates</title>

      <para>The syntax of what goes in the templates is dependent on if it is
      a CONDITION column or ACTION column. In most cases, it is identical to
      "vanilla" DRL for the LHS or RHS respectively. This means in the LHS,
      the constraint language must be used, and in the RHS it is a snippet of
      code to be executed.</para>

      <para>The "$param" place holder is used in templates to indicate where
      data form the cell will be interpolated. You can also use "$1" to the
      same effect. If the cell contains a comma separated list of values, $1
      and $2 etc. may be used to indicate which positional parameter from the
      list of values in the cell will be used. <programlisting>For example: If the templates is [Foo(bar == $param)] and the cell is [ 42 ] then the result will be [Foo(bar == 42)]
If the template is [Foo(bar &lt; $1, baz == $2)] and the cell is [42,42] then the result will be [Foo(bar &gt; 42, baz ==42)]
</programlisting></para>

      <para>For conditions: How snippets are rendered depends on if there is
      anything in the row above (where ObjectType declarations may appear). If
      there is, then the snippets are rendered as individual constraints on
      that ObjectType. If there isn't, then they are just rendered as is (with
      values substituted). If you put just a plain field (as in the example
      above) then it will assume you mean equality. If you put another
      operator at the end of the snippet, then the values will put
      interpolated at the end of the constraint, otherwise it will look for
      "$param" as outlined previously.</para>

      <para>For consequences: How snippets are rendered also depends on if
      there is anything in the row immediately above it. If there is nothing
      there, the output is simple the interpolated snippets. If there is
      something there (which would typically be a bound variable or a global
      like in the example above) then it will append it as a method call on
      that object (refer to the above example).</para>

      <para>This may be easiest to understand with some examples below.
      <screenshot>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="spanned_column.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot> The above shows how the Person ObjectType declaration
      spans 2 columns in the spreadsheet, thus both constraints will appear as
      Person(age == ... , type == ...). As before, as only the field names are
      present in the snippet, they imply an equality test. <screenshot>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="with_param.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot> The above condition example shows how you use
      interpolation to place the values in the snippet (in this case it would
      result in Person(age == "42")).<screenshot>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="operator_completion.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot> The above condition example show that if you put an
      operator on the end by itself, the values will be placed after the
      operator automatically. <screenshot>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="with_binding.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot> You can of course put a binding in before the column
      (the constraints will be added from the cells below). You can put
      anything in the ObjectType row (eg it could be a pre condition for the
      columns in the spreadsheet columns that follow).<screenshot>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="consequence.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot> This shows how the consequence could be done the by
      simple interpolation (just leave the cell above blank, the same applies
      to condition columns) - with this style you can put whatever you want in
      the consequence (not just one method call).</para>

    <title>Creating and integrating Spreadsheet based Decision Tables</title>

    <para>The API to use spreadsheet based decision tables is in the
    drools-decisiontables module. There is really only one class to look at:
    SpreadsheetCompiler. This class will take spreadsheets in various formats,
    and generate rules in DRL (which you can then use in the normal way). Also
    note that if you like you can just use the SpreadsheetComiler to generate
    partial rule files, and assemble it into a complete rule package after the
    fact (this allows to you seperate technical and non technical aspects of
    the rules if needed).</para>

    <para>To get started, you can find a sample spreadsheet and base it on
    that. Alternatively, if you are using the plug-in (Rule Workbench IDE) the
    wizard can generate a spreadsheet for you from a template (to edit it you
    will need to use an xls compatible spreadsheet editor). <screenshot>

      <para>Spreadsheets are well established business tools (in use for over

          <para>Decision table is handed to a technical resource, who maps the
          business language (descriptions) to scripts (this may involve
          software development of course, if it is a new application or data
          model !)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Technical person hands back and reviews the modifications with
          the business analyst.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The business analyst can continue editing the rule rows as
          needed (moving columns around is also fine etc).</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>In parallel, the technical person can develop test cases for
          the rules (liaising with business analysts) as these test cases can
          be used to verify rules and rule changes once the system is
          running.</para>

      <title>Using spreadsheet features</title>

      <para>You can use the features of applications like Excel to provide
      assistance in entering data into spreadsheets, such as validating
      fields. You can use lists that are stored in other worksheets to provide
      valid lists of values for cells, like in the following diagram.

            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="lists.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot></para>

      <para>Some applications provide a limited ability to keep a history of
      changes, but it is recommended that an alternative means of revision
      control is also used. So when you are making changes to rules over time,
      older versions are archived (many solutions exist for this which are
      also open source, such as Subversion).
