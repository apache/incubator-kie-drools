  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>Imagine you are developing a BPM solution which mixes process with business data. Imagine also
    you need some forms to be used within processes in order to let the users enter data. Moreover,
    you'll likely want to have some kind of dashboards to display metrics and key performance
    indicators in order to quickly assess how your processes are doing. So far so good.
  </para>

  <para>jBPM brings you all the ingredients you need to develop end-to-end business process solutions.
    The jBPM's BAM module (also known as Dashboard Builder or just Dashbuilder) allows for composing
    custom business dashboards mixing data coming from heterogeneous sources of information. The module is now
    fully integrated into KIE workbench. A new specific section for dealing with dashboards has been added
    and it can be accessed either from the home page or from the menu bar, as shown in the next figure.

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Business Dashboards:</emphasis>
        This option is intended to give users access to the generic dashboard tooling either to compose new dashboards
        or just to consume existing ones.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Process &amp; Task Dashboard:</emphasis>
        It opens up the Process Dashboard perspective which contains several performance indicators related to the jBPM
        execution engine.
