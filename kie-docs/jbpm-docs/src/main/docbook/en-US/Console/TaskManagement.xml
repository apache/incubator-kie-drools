                     <para>Tasks can have associated a Form to store data. If tasks are part of a
                            Business Process, usually some data needs to be collected and propagated
                            to the business process for further usage. For that reason, tasks has to
                            provide a way to gather and store data. Forms can be created for
                            specific tasks using the Form Modeller. If no form is provided a dynamic
                            form will be created based on the information that the task needs to
                            handle. If a task is created as an ad-hoc task (not related with any
                            process) there will be no such information to generate a form and only
                            basic actions will be provided. </para>

              <para>As mentioned in the introduction a User can create their own tasks, which will
                     not be associated with any Business Process. These tasks can be used to keep
                     track of your personal list of TO DOs. You can also create tasks and assign
                     them to different people in your team or group. </para>
