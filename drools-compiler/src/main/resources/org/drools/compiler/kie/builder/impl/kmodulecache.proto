// WARNING: Before changing this file, make sure you know what you
// are doing by reading the protobuf documentation at
//
// http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/
//
// in special, please node that to keep backward compatibility
// you need to comply to a set of practices that are listed on the
// documentation and quoted here:
//
// * you must not change the tag numbers of any existing fields.
// * you must not add or delete any required fields. At this moment,
//   as a best practice we are not using required fields at all.
// * you may delete optional or repeated fields. The best practice
//   though is to rename the field by prepending it with the prefix
//   OBSOLETE_
// * you may add new optional or repeated fields but you must use
//   fresh tag numbers (i.e. tag numbers that were never used in
//   this protocol buffer, not even by deleted fields).
