  <title>Data enumerations (drop down list configurations)</title>

  <para>Data enumerations are an optional asset type that technical folk can
  configure to provide drop down lists for the guided editor. These are stored
  and edited just like any other asset, and apply to the package that they
  belong to.</para>

  <para>The contents of an enum config are a mapping of Fact.field to a list
  of values to be used in a drop down. That list can either be literal, or use
  a utility class (which you put on the classpath) to load a list of strings.
  The strings are either a value to be shown on a drop down, or a mapping from
  the code value (what ends up used in the rule) and a display value (see the
  example below, using the '=').</para>

  <para>In the above diagram - the "MM" indicates a value that will be used in
  the rule, yet "Mini Mal" will be displayed in the GUI.</para>

  <para>Getting data lists from external data sources: It is possible to have 
    Drools Workbench call a piece of code which will load a list of Strings. To do
  this, you will need a bit of code that returns a <code>java.util.List</code>
    (of String's) to be on the classpath of Drools Workbench. Instead of specifying a
    list of values in Drools Workbench itself - the code can return the list of
  Strings (you can use the "=" inside the strings if you want to use a
  different display value to the rule value, as normal). For example, in the
  'Person.age' line above, you could change it to:</para>

  <programlisting> 'Person.age' : (new com.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfAges()</programlisting>

  <para>This assumes you have a class called "DataHelper" which has a method
  "getListOfAges()" which returns a List of strings (and is on the classpath).
  You can of course mix these "dynamic" enumerations with fixed lists. You
  could for example load from a database using JDBC. The data enumerations are
  loaded the first time you use the guided editor in a session. If you have
  any guided editor sessions open - you will need to close and then open the
  rule to see the change. To check the enumeration is loaded - if you go to
  the Package configuration screen, you can "save and validate" the package -
  this will check it and provide any error feedback.</para>

    <title>Advanced enumeration concepts</title>

    <para>There are a few other advanced things you can do with data
    enumerations.</para>

    <para>Drop down lists that depend on field values: Lets imagine a simple
    fact model, we have a class called Vehicle, which has 2 fields:
    "engineType" and "fuelType". We want to have a choice for the "engineType"
    of "Petrol" or "Diesel". Now, obviously the choice type for fuel must be
    dependent on the engine type (so for Petrol we have ULP and PULP, and for
    Diesel we have BIO and NORMAL). We can express this dependency in an
    enumeration as:</para>

    <programlisting>'Vehicle.engineType' : ['Petrol', 'Diesel']
'Vehicle.fuelType[engineType=Petrol]' : ['ULP', 'PULP' ]
'Vehicle.fuelType[engineType=Diesel]' : ['BIO', 'NORMAL' ]</programlisting>

    <para>This shows how it is possible to make the choices dependent on other
    field values. Note that once you pick the engineType, the choice list for
    the fuelType will be determined.</para>

    <para>Loading enums programmatically: In some cases, people may want to
    load their enumeration data entirely from external data source (such as a
    relational database). To do this, you can implement a class that returns a
    Map. The key of the map is a string (which is the Fact.field name as shown
    above), and the value is a <code>java.util.List</code> of Strings.</para>

    <programlisting language="Java">public class SampleDataSource2 {

  public Map&lt;String&gt;, List&lt;String&gt; loadData() {
    Map data = new HashMap();

    List d = new ArrayList();
    d.add("value1");
    d.add("value2");
    data.put("Fact.field", d);

    return data;
 }

}</programlisting>

    <para>And in the enumeration in the BRMS, you put:</para>

    <programlisting language="Java">=(new SampleDataSource2()).loadData()</programlisting>

    <para>The "=" tells it to load the data by executing your code.</para>

    <para>Mode advanced enumerations: In the above cases, the values in the
    lists are calculated up front. This is fine for relatively static data, or
    small amounts of data. Imagine a scenario where you have lists of
    countries, each country has a list of states, each state has a list of
    localities, each locality has a list of streets and so on... You can see
    how this is a lot of data, and it can not be loaded up. The lists should
    be loaded dependent on what country was selected etc...</para>

    <para>Well the above can be addressed in the following fashion:</para>

    <programlisting>'Fact.field[dependentField1, dependentField2]' : '(new com.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfAges("@{dependentField1}", "@{dependentField2}")'</programlisting>

    <para>Similar to above, but note that we have just specified what fields
    are needed, and also on the right of the ":" there are quotes around the
    expression. This expression will then be evaluated, only when needed,
    substituting the values from the fields specified. This means you can use
    the field values from the GUI to drive a database query, and drill down
    into data etc. When the drop down is loaded, or the rule loaded, it will
    refresh the list based on the fields. 'dependentField1' and
    'dependentField2' are names of fields on the 'Fact' type - these are used
    to calculate the list of values which will be shown in a drop down if
    values for the "field".</para>
