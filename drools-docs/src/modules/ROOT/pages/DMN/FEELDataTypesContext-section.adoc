= Contexts

FEEL allows creating contexts through `context literals`. A `context` in FEEL is a list of key/value pairs,
similar to Maps in languages like Java. For example, the following literal expression creates a context with two entries,
x and y, representing a coordinate in a chart:

```
{ x : 5, y : 3 }
```

There is no explicit way of declaring a variable as a `context` in the DMN specification. Drools extends the
DMN built-in types with the `context` type for that reason.

WARNING: A `context` datatype is an extension of the specification and is subject to change if the DMN specification
provides a standard way to declare contexts in the future. In DMN 1.1, the recommended way of declaring contexts is to
create an item definition that contains the list of keys as attributes, and then declare the variable as having that
item definition type.
