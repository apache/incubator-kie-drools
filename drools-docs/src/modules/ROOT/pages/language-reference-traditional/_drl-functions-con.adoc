= Functions in DRL

Functions in DRL files put semantic code in your rule source file instead of in Java classes. Functions are especially useful if an action (`then`) part of a rule is used repeatedly and only the parameters differ for each rule. Above the rules in the DRL file, you can declare the function or import a static method from a helper class as a function, and then use the function by name in an action (`then`) part of the rule.

The following examples illustrate a function that is either declared or an imported static method in a DRL file:

.Example function declaration with a rule (option 1)
[source]
----
function String hello(String applicantName) {
    return "Hello " + applicantName + "!";
}

rule "Using a function"
  when
    // Empty
  then
    System.out.println( hello( "James" ) );
end
----

.Example import a static method of a Java class (option 2)
[source,java]
----
package org.example.applicant;

public class MyFunctions {

    public static String hello(String applicantName) {
        return "Hello " + applicantName + "!";
    }
}
----

[source]
----
import static org.example.applicant.MyFunctions.hello;

rule "Using a function"
  when
    // Empty
  then
    System.out.println( hello( "James" ) );
end
----

[NOTE]
====
A function declared in a DRL file cannot be imported to a rule in a different package while a Java static method in a different package can be imported.
