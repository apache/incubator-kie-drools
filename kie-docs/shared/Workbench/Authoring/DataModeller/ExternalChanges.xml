  <title>External changes to models</title>

  <para>It is possible to modify a project's assets externally, i.e. accessing
  them directly through the project's repository. While NOT a recommended
  practice, it is important to be aware of the implications this
  entails.</para>

  <caution>
    <para>Performing changes to the data model outside of the context of the
    application is NOT recommended, and could lead to loss of
    information!</para>
  </caution>

  <para>From an application context's perspective, we can basically identify
  two different scenarios:</para>

  <para/>

  <section>
    <title>No changes have been undertaken through the application</title>

    <para>In this scenario the application user has basically just been
    navigating through the data model, without making any changes to it.
    Meanwhile, another user modifies the data model externally.</para>

    <para>In this case, no immediate warning is issued to the application
    user. However, as soon as the user tries to make any kind of change, such
    as add or remove data objects or properties, or change any of the existing
    ones, the following pop-up will be shown:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>External changes warning</title>

      <screenshot>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/extchanges_reopen_ignore.jpg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>
    </figure>

    <para/>

    <para>The user can choose to either:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Re-open the data model, thus loading any external changes, and
        then perform the modification he was about to undertake, or</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Ignore any external changes, and go ahead with the modification
        to the model. In this case, when trying to persist these changes,
        another pop-up warning will be shown:</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Force save / re-open</title>

          <screenshot>
            <mediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/extchanges_forcesave_reopen.jpg"/>
              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </screenshot>
        </figure>

        <para>The "Force Save" option will effectively overwrite any external
        changes, while "Re-open" will discard any local changes and reload the
        model.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>"Force Save" overwrites any external changes!</para>
        </warning>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para/>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Changes have been undertaken through the application</title>

    <para>The application user has made changes to the data model. Meanwhile,
    another user simultaneously modifies the data model from outside the
    application context.</para>

    <para>In this alternative scenario, immediately after the external user
    commits his changes to the asset repository, a warning is issued to the
    application user:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>External changes warning</title>

      <screenshot>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/extchanges_reopen_ignore.jpg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>
    </figure>

    <para/>

    <para>As with the previous scenario, the user can choose to either:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Re-open the data model, thus losing any modifications that where
        made through the application, or</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Ignore any external changes, and continue working on the
        model.</para>

        <para>One of the following possibilities can now occur:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The user tries to persist the changes he made to the model
            by clicking the "Save" button in the data modeller top level menu.
            This leads to the following warning message:</para>

            <figure>
              <title>Force save / re-open</title>

              <screenshot>
                <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="images/Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/extchanges_forcesave_reopen.jpg"/>
                  </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
              </screenshot>
            </figure>

            <para>The "Force Save" option will effectively overwrite any
            external changes, while "Re-open" will discard any local changes
            and reload the model.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The user switches to another project. In this case he will
            be warned of the existence of non-persisted local changes through
            the following warning message:</para>

            <figure>
              <title>Project switch warning</title>

              <screenshot>
                <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="images/Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/project-switch_save.jpg"/>
                  </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
              </screenshot>
            </figure>

			<para/>

            <para>If the user chooses to persist the local changes, then
            another pop-up message will point out the existance of the changes
            that were made externally:</para>

            <figure>
              <title>Project switch external changes warning</title>

              <screenshot>
                <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="images/Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/extchanges_projswitch_forcesave_discard.jpg"/>
                  </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
              </screenshot>
            </figure>

            <para>The "Yes, Force Save" option will effectively overwrite any
            external changes, while "No, Discard my Changes" will switch to
            the other project, discarding any local changes.</para>
