Declarations in DRL files define new fact types or metadata for fact types to be used by rules in the DRL file:

* *New fact types:* The default fact type in the `java.lang` package of {PRODUCT} is `Object`, but you can declare other types in DRL files as needed. Declaring fact types in DRL files enables you to define a new fact model directly in the {RULE_ENGINE}, without creating models in a lower-level language like Java. You can also declare a new type when a domain model is already built and you want to complement this model with additional entities that are used mainly during the reasoning process.
* *Metadata for fact types:* You can associate metadata in the format `@key(value)` with new or existing facts. Metadata can be any kind of data that is not represented by the fact attributes and is consistent among all instances of that fact type. The metadata can be queried at run time by the {RULE_ENGINE} and used in the reasoning process.
