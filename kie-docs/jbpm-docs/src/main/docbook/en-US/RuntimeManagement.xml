              <para> In version 5.x processes were stored in so called packages produced by Guvnor
                     and next downloaded by jbpm console for execution using KnowledgeAgent.
                     Alternatively one could drop their process files (bpmn2 files) into a
                     predefined directory that was scanned on the jbpm console start. That was it.
                     That enforces users to always use Guvnor when dynamic deployment was needed.
                     Although there is nothing wrong with it, actually that was recommended approach
                     but not everytime it was desired. </para>
              <para>Version 6, on the other hand moves away from proprietary packages in favor of,
                     well known and mature, Apache Maven based packaging - known as knowledge
                     archives - kjar. Processes, rules etc (aka business assets) are now part of a
                     simple jar file built and managed by Maven. Along the business assets, java
                     classes and other file types are stored in the jar file too. Moreover, as any
                     other maven artifact, kjar can have defined dependencies on other artifacts
                     including other kjars. What makes the kjar special when compared with regular
                     jars is a single descriptor file kept inside META-INF directory of the kjar -
                     kmodule.xml. That descriptor allows to define:</para>

              <para>By default, this descriptor is empty (just kmodule root element) and is
                     considered as marker file. Whenever a runtime component (such as jbpm console)
                     is about to process kjar it looks up kmodule.xml to build its runtime
                     representation. In addition to kmodule.xml a deployment descriptor (that
                     provides fine graind control over deployment) is available (since 6.1). </para>

                            Deployment descriptors are used in hierarchical way meaning they can be
                            placed on various levels of the system and merged on runtime. jBPM
                            supports following levels of deployment descriptors:</para>

                                                 deployments on given server</para>

                                                 that is given at the time of deployment</para>

                     </para>
                     <para>Deployment descriptors on different levels are merged on deployment time
                            where the master is considered descriptor lower in the hierarchy and
                            slave one that is higher in hierarchy. To give an example, when a kjar
                            is deployed and it contains deployment descriptor kjar's deployment
                            descriptor is considered slave and server level descriptor is considered
                            master. With default merge mode it will override all master entries with
                            slave ones as long as they are not empty and combine all
                            collections.</para>
                     <para>Since kjar can have dependencies to other kjars, and in turn that
                            dependencies might have deployment descriptors as well, they will be
                            placed in deployment descriptors hierarchy lower than the actual kjar
                            that is being deployed. With that said, this is how it will look like
                            from hierarchy point of view, starting with master (server
                            level):</para>

                            performed. The default (and easiest) is reflection that will use both

                            object. Parameters in this case can be  String or another object model
                            for representing other types than String. Following is an example of an
                            object model that will create an instance of
                            org.jbpm.test.CustomStrategy using reflection resolver that will use
                            constructor of that class with two String parameters. Note that String
                            paramaters are created with different ways (using object model - first

                     <para>In case reflection based resolver is not enough, more advanced resolver
                            can be used that utilizes power of MVEL language.  It's much easier in
                            the configuration as it expects mvel expression as identifier of the
                            object model. It will provide the out of the box parameters (listed
                            above: runtime manager, kie session, etc) into the mvel context while
                            evaluating expression. To define object model with mvel resolver use
                            following xml (that will be equivalent to replection based
                            above):<programlisting>...

                     <para>Last but not least, there is Spring based resolver available as well that
                            allows to simply look up a bean by its identifier from spring
                            application context. This resolver is not used in jbpm console
                            (kie-workbench) as it does not use spring but whenever jBPM is used
                            together with Spring it might become handy when deploying kjars into the
                            runtime. It's very simple definition in xml, again equivalent to the
                            other one assuming org.jbpm.test.CustomStrategy is registered in spring
                            application context under customStrategy

                            descriptor will be copied into the one placed in the project. Further
                            changes can be done directly in the xml content (in next versions more
                            user friendly editor will most likely be provided). It is accessible
                            from Administration perspecitve as this is considered technical

                     <para>jbpm console (kie-workbench) provides access restriction to repositories
                            that can be configured with supplementary tool called kie-config-cli.
                            This protects repositories in the authoring perspsective based on roles
                            membership. Deployment descriptors moves this capability to the runtime
                            engine by ensuring that access to processes will be granted only to
                            users that belong to groups defined in the deployment descriptor as
                            required roles. By default when project is created (at the same time
                            deployment descriptor is created as well) required roles are
                            automatically filled in based on repository restrictions. These roles
                            can be still altered by editing deployment descriptor via Administration
                            perspective as presented in Manage deployment descriptor section.</para>
