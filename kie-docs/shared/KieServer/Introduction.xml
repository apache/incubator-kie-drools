  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The KIE Execution Server is a standalone, out-of-the-box component that can be used to
              instantiate and execute rules via interfaces available for REST, JMS or a Java client
              side application. Created as a web deployable WAR file, this engine can be deployed on
              any web container.</para>
  <para>This server has a low footprint, with minimal memory consumption, and therefore, can be
              deployed easily on a cloud instance. Each instance of this server can open and
              instantiate multiple Kie Containers which allows you to execute multiple rule services
              in parallel.</para>
  <para>You can provision execution server instances via KIE Workbench. In this chapter, we will
              go through the steps required to setup an execution server, provision and connect to
              this server via KIE Workbench, control what rule artifacts go in each instance and
              go through its lifecycle.</para>
