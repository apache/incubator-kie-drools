  <para>Type declarations have two main goals in the rules engine: to allow
  the declaration of new types, and to allow the declaration of metadata for
  types.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Declaring new types:</emphasis> Drools works
      out of the box with plain Java objects as facts. Sometimes, however,
      users may want to define the model directly to the rules engine, without
      worrying about creating models in a lower level language like Java. At
      other times, there is a domain model already built, but eventually the
      user wants or needs to complement this model with additional entities
      that are used mainly during the reasoning process.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Declaring metadata:</emphasis> facts may
      have meta information associated to them. Examples of meta information
      include any kind of data that is not represented by the fact attributes
      and is consistent among all instances of that fact type. This meta
      information may be queried at runtime by the engine and used in the
      reasoning process.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <section>
    <title>Declaring New Types</title>

    <para>To declare a new type, all you need to do is use the keyword
    <literal>declare</literal>, followed by the list of fields, and the
    keyword <literal>end</literal>. A new fact must have a list of fields,
    otherwise the engine will look for an existing fact class in the classpath
    and raise an error if not found.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Declaring a new fact type: Address</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Address
   number : int
   streetName : String
   city : String
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The previous example declares a new fact type called
    <code>Address</code>. This fact type will have three attributes:
    <code>number</code>, <code>streetName</code> and <code>city</code>. Each
    attribute has a type that can be any valid Java type, including any other
    class created by the user or even other fact types previously
    declared.</para>

    <para>For instance, we may want to declare another fact type
    <code>Person</code>:</para>

    <example>
      <title>declaring a new fact type: Person</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    name : String
    dateOfBirth : java.util.Date
    address : Address
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>As we can see on the previous example, <code>dateOfBirth</code> is
    of type <code>java.util.Date</code>, from the Java API, while
    <code>address</code> is of the previously defined fact type
    Address.</para>

    <para>You may avoid having to write the fully qualified name of a class
    every time you write it by using the <literal>import</literal> clause, as
    previously discussed.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Avoiding the need to use fully qualified class names by using
      import</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> java.util.Date

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    name : String
    dateOfBirth : Date
    address : Address
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>When you declare a new fact type, Drools will, at compile time,
    generate bytecode that implements a Java class representing the fact type.
    The generated Java class will be a one-to-one Java Bean mapping of the
    type definition. So, for the previous example, the generated Java class
    would be:</para>

    <example>
      <title>generated Java class for the previous Person fact type
      declaration</title>

      <programlisting language="java">public class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private java.util.Date dateOfBirth;
    private Address address;

    // empty constructor
    public Person() {...}

    // constructor with all fields 
    public Person( String name, Date dateOfBirth, Address address ) {...}

    // if keys are defined, constructor with keys
    public Person( ...keys... ) {...}

    // getters and setters
    // equals/hashCode
    // toString
}
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Since the generated class is a simple Java class, it can be used
    transparently in the rules, like any other fact.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using the declared types in rules</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">rule</emphasis> "Using a declared Type"
<emphasis role="bold">when</emphasis> 
    $p : Person( name == "Bob" )
<emphasis role="bold">then</emphasis>
    <emphasis>// Insert Mark, who is Bob's mate.</emphasis>
    Person mark = new Person();
    mark.setName("Mark");
    insert( mark );
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
    </example>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Declaring Metadata</title>

    <para>Metadata may be assigned to several different constructions in
    Drools: fact types, fact attributes and rules. Drools uses the at sign
    ('@') to introduce metadata, and it always uses the form:</para>

    <programlisting>@<emphasis>metadata_key</emphasis>( <emphasis>metadata_value</emphasis> )</programlisting>

    <para>The parenthesized <emphasis>metadata_value</emphasis> is
    optional.</para>

    <para>For instance, if you want to declare a metadata attribute like
    <code>author</code>, whose value is <emphasis>Bob</emphasis>, you could
    simply write:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Declaring a metadata attribute</title>

      <programlisting>@author( Bob )</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Drools allows the declaration of any arbitrary metadata attribute,
    but some will have special meaning to the engine, while others are simply
    available for querying at runtime. Drools allows the declaration of
    metadata both for fact types and for fact attributes. Any metadata that is
    declared before the attributes of a fact type are assigned to the fact
    type, while metadata declared after an attribute are assigned to that
    particular attribute.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Declaring metadata attributes for fact types and
      attributes</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> java.util.Date

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    <emphasis>@author</emphasis>( Bob )
    <emphasis>@dateOfCreation</emphasis>( 01-Feb-2009 )

    name : String <emphasis>@key @maxLength</emphasis>( 30 )
    dateOfBirth : Date 
    address : Address
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>In the previous example, there are two metadata items declared for
    the fact type (<code>@author</code> and <code>@dateOfCreation</code>) and
    two more defined for the name attribute (<code>@key</code> and
    <code>@maxLength</code>). Please note that the <code>@key</code> metadata
    has no required value, and so the parentheses and the value were
    omitted.:</para>

    <para>@position can be used to declare the position of a field, overriding
    the default declared order. This is used for positional constraints in
    patterns.</para>

    <programlisting>declare Cheese
    name : String @position(1)
    shop : String @position(2)
    price : int @position(0)
end
</programlisting>

    <section>
      <title>Predefined class level annotations</title>

      <para>Some annotations have predefined semantics that are interpreted by
      the engine. The following is a list of some of these predefined
      annotations and their meaning.</para>

      <section>
        <title>@role( &lt;fact | event&gt; )</title>

        <para>The @role annotation defines how the engine should handle instances of that type:
          either as regular facts or as events. It accepts two possible values:</para>
        
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>fact : this is the default, declares that the type is to be
              handled as a regular fact.</para>
          </listitem>
          
          <listitem>
            <para>event : declares that the type is to be handled as an
              event.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        
        <para>The following example declares that the fact type StockTick in a stock broker
          application is to be handled as an event.</para>
        
        <example>
          <title>declaring a fact type as an event</title>
          
          <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> some.package.StockTick

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> StockTick
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
        </example>
        
        <para>The same applies to facts declared inline. If StockTick was a fact type declared in
          the DRL itself, instead of a previously existing class, the code would be:</para>
        
        <example>
          <title>declaring a fact type and assigning it the event role</title>
          
          <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> StockTick 
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )

    datetime : java.util.Date
    symbol : String
    price : double
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
        </example>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@typesafe( &lt;boolean&gt; )</title>

        <para>By default all type declarations are compiled with type safety
        enabled; @typesafe( false ) provides a means to override this
        behaviour by permitting a fall-back, to type unsafe evaluation where
        all constraints are generated as MVEL constraints and executed
        dynamically. This can be important when dealing with collections that
        do not have any generics or mixed type collections.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@timestamp( &lt;attribute name&gt; )</title>

        <para>Every event has an associated timestamp assigned to it. By default,
          the timestamp for a given event is read from the Session Clock and
          assigned to the event at the time the event is inserted into the working
          memory. Although, sometimes, the event has the timestamp as one of it's
          own attributes. In this case, the user may tell the engine to use the
          timestamp from the event's attribute instead of reading it from the
          Session Clock.</para>
        
        <programlisting><emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( &lt;attributeName&gt; )</programlisting>
        
        <para>To tell the engine what attribute to use as the source of the
          event's timestamp, just list the attribute name as a parameter to the
          @timestamp tag.</para>
        
        <example>
          <title>declaring the VoiceCall timestamp attribute</title>
          
          <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
    <emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( callDateTime )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
        </example>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@duration( &lt;attribute name&gt; )</title>

        <para>Drools supports both event semantics: point-in-time events and
          interval-based events. A point-in-time event is represented as an
          interval-based event whose duration is zero. By default, all events have
          duration zero. The user may attribute a different duration for an event by
          declaring which attribute in the event type contains the duration of the
          event.</para>
        
        <programlisting><emphasis>@duration</emphasis>( &lt;attributeName&gt; )</programlisting>
        
        <para>So, for our VoiceCall fact type, the declaration would be:</para>
        
        <example>
          <title>declaring the VoiceCall duration attribute</title>
          
          <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
    <emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( callDateTime )
    <emphasis>@duration</emphasis>( callDuration )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
        </example>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@expires( &lt;time interval&gt; )</title>

        <important>
          <para>This tag is only considered when running the engine in STREAM
            mode. Also, additional discussion on the effects of using this tag is
            made on the Memory Management section. It is included here for
            completeness.</para>
        </important>
        
        <para>Events may be automatically expired after some time in the working
          memory. Typically this happens when, based on the existing rules in the
          knowledge base, the event can no longer match and activate any rules.
          Although, it is possible to explicitly define when an event should
          expire.</para>
        
        <programlisting><emphasis>@expires</emphasis>( &lt;timeOffset&gt; )</programlisting>
        
        <para>The value of <emphasis>timeOffset</emphasis> is a temporal interval
          in the form:</para>
        
        <programlisting>[#d][#h][#m][#s][#[ms]]</programlisting>
        
        <para>Where <emphasis>[ ]</emphasis> means an optional parameter and
          <emphasis>#</emphasis> means a numeric value.</para>
        
        <para>So, to declare that the VoiceCall facts should be expired after 1
          hour and 35 minutes after they are inserted into the working memory, the
          user would write:</para>
        
        <example>
          <title>declaring the expiration offset for the VoiceCall events</title>
          
          <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
    <emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( callDateTime )
    <emphasis>@duration</emphasis>( callDuration )
    <emphasis>@expires</emphasis>( 1h35m )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
        </example>
        
        <para>The @expires policy will take precedence and override the implicit
          expiration offset calculated from temporal constraints and sliding windows
          in the knowledge base.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@propertyChangeSupport</title>

        <para>Facts that implement support for property changes as defined in
        the Javabean(tm) spec, now can be annotated so that the engine
        register itself to listen for changes on fact properties. The boolean
        parameter that was used in the insert() method in the Drools 4 API is
        deprecated and does not exist in the drools-api module.</para>

        <example>
          <title>@propertyChangeSupport</title>

          <programlisting>declare Person
  @propertyChangeSupport
end</programlisting>
        </example>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@propertyReactive</title>

        <para>Make this type property reactive. See Fine grained property
        change listeners section for details.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Predefined attribute level annotations</title>

      <para>As noted before, Drools also supports annotations in type
      attributes. Here is a list of predefined attribute annotations.</para>

      <section>
        <title>@key</title>

        <para>Declaring an attribute as a key attribute has 2 major effects on
        generated types:</para>

        <para><orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The attribute will be used as a key identifier for the
              type, and as so, the generated class will implement the equals()
              and hashCode() methods taking the attribute into account when
              comparing instances of this type.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Drools will generate a constructor using all the key
              attributes as parameters.</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>For instance:</para>

        <example>
          <title>example of @key declarations for a type</title>

          <programlisting>declare Person
    firstName : String @key
    lastName : String @key
    age : int
end
</programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>For the previous example, Drools will generate equals() and
        hashCode() methods that will check the firstName and lastName
        attributes to determine if two instances of Person are equal to each
        other, but will not check the age attribute. It will also generate a
        constructor taking firstName and lastName as parameters, allowing one
        to create instances with a code like this:</para>

        <example>
          <title>creating an instance using the key constructor</title>

          <programlisting>Person person = new Person( "John", "Doe" );</programlisting>
        </example>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@position</title>

        <para>Patterns support positional arguments on type
        declarations.</para>

        <para>Positional arguments are ones where you don't need to specify
        the field name, as the position maps to a known named field. i.e.
        Person( name == "mark" ) can be rewritten as Person( "mark"; ). The
        semicolon ';' is important so that the engine knows that everything
        before it is a positional argument. Otherwise we might assume it was a
        boolean expression, which is how it could be interpreted after the
        semicolon. You can mix positional and named arguments on a pattern by
        using the semicolon ';' to separate them. Any variables used in a
        positional that have not yet been bound will be bound to the field
        that maps to that position.</para>

        <programlisting>declare Cheese
    name : String
    shop : String
    price : int
end
</programlisting>

        <para>The default order is the declared order, but this can be
        overridden using @position</para>

        <programlisting>declare Cheese
    name : String @position(1)
    shop : String @position(2)
    price : int @position(0)
end
</programlisting>

        <para>The @Position annotation, in the org.drools.definition.type
        package, can be used to annotate original pojos on the classpath.
        Currently only fields on classes can be annotated. Inheritance of
        classes is supported, but not interfaces of methods yet.</para>

        <para>Example patterns, with two constraints and a binding. Remember
        semicolon ';' is used to differentiate the positional section from the
        named argument section. Variables and literals and expressions using
        just literals are supported in positional arguments, but not
        variables.</para>

        <programlisting>
Cheese( "stilton", "Cheese Shop", p; )
Cheese( "stilton", "Cheese Shop"; p : price )
Cheese( "stilton"; shop == "Cheese Shop", p : price )
Cheese( name == "stilton"; shop == "Cheese Shop", p : price )
</programlisting>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Declaring Metadata for Existing Types</title>

    <para>Drools allows the declaration of metadata attributes for existing
    types in the same way as when declaring metadata attributes for new fact
    types. The only difference is that there are no fields in that
    declaration.</para>

    <para>For instance, if there is a class org.drools.examples.Person, and
    one wants to declare metadata for it, it's possible to write the following
    code:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Declaring metadata for an existing type</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> org.drools.examples.Person

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    <emphasis>@author</emphasis>( Bob )
    <emphasis>@dateOfCreation</emphasis>( 01-Feb-2009 )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Instead of using the import, it is also possible to reference the
    class by its fully qualified name, but since the class will also be
    referenced in the rules, it is usually shorter to add the import and use
    the short class name everywhere.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Declaring metadata using the fully qualified class name</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> org.drools.examples.Person
    <emphasis>@author</emphasis>( Bob )
    <emphasis>@dateOfCreation</emphasis>( 01-Feb-2009 )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
    </example>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Parametrized constructors for declared types</title>

    <para>Generate constructors with parameters for declared types.</para>

    <para>Example: for a declared type like the following:</para>

    <programlisting>declare Person
    firstName : String @key
    lastName : String @key
    age : int
end
</programlisting>

    <para>The compiler will implicitly generate 3 constructors: one without
    parameters, one with the @key fields, and one with all fields.</para>

    <programlisting>Person() // parameterless constructor
Person( String firstName, String lastName )
Person( String firstName, String lastName, int age )</programlisting>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Non Typesafe Classes</title>

    <para>@typesafe( &lt;boolean&gt;) has been added to type declarations. By
    default all type declarations are compiled with type safety enabled;
    @typesafe( false ) provides a means to override this behaviour by
    permitting a fall-back, to type unsafe evaluation where all constraints
    are generated as MVEL constraints and executed dynamically. This can be
    important when dealing with collections that do not have any generics or
    mixed type collections.</para>

    <title>Accessing Declared Types from the Application Code</title>

    <para>Declared types are usually used inside rules files, while Java
    models are used when sharing the model between rules and applications.
    Although, sometimes, the application may need to access and handle facts
    from the declared types, especially when the application is wrapping the
    rules engine and providing higher level, domain specific user interfaces
    for rules management.</para>

    <para>In such cases, the generated classes can be handled as usual with
    the Java Reflection API, but, as we know, that usually requires a lot of
    work for small results. Therefore, Drools provides a simplified API for
    the most common fact handling the application may want to do.</para>

    <para>The first important thing to realize is that a declared fact will
    belong to the package where it was declared. So, for instance, in the
    example below, <code>Person</code> will belong to the
    <code>org.drools.examples</code> package, and so the fully qualified name
    of the generated class will be
    <code>org.drools.examples.Person</code>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Declaring a type in the org.drools.examples package</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">package</emphasis> org.drools.examples

<emphasis role="bold">import</emphasis> java.util.Date

<emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> Person
    name : String
    dateOfBirth : Date
    address : Address
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Declared types, as discussed previously, are generated at knowledge
    base compilation time, i.e., the application will only have access to them
    at application run time. Therefore, these classes are not available for
    direct reference from the application.</para>

    <para>Drools then provides an interface through which users can handle
    declared types from the application code:
    <code>org.drools.definition.type.FactType</code>. Through this interface,
    the user can instantiate, read and write fields in the declared fact
    types.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Handling declared fact types through the API</title>

      <programlisting>// get a reference to a knowledge base with a declared type:
KieBase kbase = ...

// get the declared FactType
FactType personType = kbase.getFactType( "org.drools.examples",
                                         "Person" );

// handle the type as necessary:
// create instances:
Object bob = personType.newInstance();

// set attributes values
personType.set( bob,
                "name",
                "Bob" );
personType.set( bob,
                "age",
                42 );

// insert fact into a session
KieSession ksession = ...
ksession.insert( bob );
ksession.fireAllRules();

// read attributes
String name = personType.get( bob, "name" );
int age = personType.get( bob, "age" );

</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The API also includes other helpful methods, like setting all the
    attributes at once, reading values from a Map, or reading all attributes
    at once, into a Map.</para>

    <para>Although the API is similar to Java reflection (yet much simpler to
    use), it does not use reflection underneath, relying on much more
    performant accessors implemented with generated bytecode.</para>

    <title>Type Declaration 'extends'</title>

    <para>Type declarations now support 'extends' keyword for
    inheritance</para>

    <para>In order to extend a type declared in Java by a DRL declared
    subtype, repeat the supertype in a declare statement without any
    fields.</para>

    <programlisting>import org.people.Person

declare Person
end

declare Student extends Person
    school : String
end

declare LongTermStudent extends Student
    years : int
    course : String
end</programlisting>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Traits</title>
    <para>WARNING : this feature is still experimental and subject to changes</para>

    <para>The same fact may have multiple dynamic types which do not fit naturally in a class
      hierarchy. Traits allow to model this very common scenario. A trait is an interface that can
      be applied (and eventually removed) to an individual object at runtime. To create a trait
      rather than a traditional bean, one has to declare them explicitly as in the following
      example:</para>

    <programlisting>declare trait GoldenCustomer
    // fields will map to getters/setters
    code     : String
    balance  : long
    discount : int
    maxExpense : long
end</programlisting>

    <para>At runtime, this declaration results in an interface, which can be used to write patterns,
      but can not be instantiated directly. In order to apply a trait to an object, we provide the
      new don keyword, which can be used as simply as this:</para>

    <programlisting>when
    $c : Customer()
then
    GoldenCustomer gc = don( $c, GoldenCustomer.class );
end</programlisting>

    <para>when a core object dons a trait, a proxy class is created on the fly (one such class will
      be generated lazily for each core/trait class combination). The proxy instance, which wraps
      the core object and implements the trait interface, is inserted automatically and will
      possibly activate other rules. An immediate advantage of declaring and using interfaces,
      getting the implementation proxy for free from the engine, is that multiple inheritance
      hierarchies can be exploited when writing rules. The core classes, however, need not implement
      any of those interfaces statically, also facilitating the use of legacy classes as cores. In
      fact, any object can don a trait, provided that they are declared as @Traitable. Notice that
      this annotation used to be optional, but now is mandatory.</para>

    <programlisting>import org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Traitable;
declare Customer
    @Traitable
    code    : String
    balance : long
end</programlisting>

    <para>The only connection between core classes and trait interfaces is at the proxy level: a
      trait is not specifically tied to a core class. This means that the same trait can be applied
      to totally different objects. For this reason, the trait does not transparently expose the
      fields of its core object. So, when writing a rule using a trait interface, only the fields of
      the interface will be available, as usual. However, any field in the interface that
      corresponds to a core object field, will be mapped by the proxy class:</para>

    <programlisting>when
    $o: OrderItem( $p : price, $code : custCode )
    $c: GoldenCustomer( code == $code, $a : balance, $d: discount )
then
    $c.setBalance( $a - $p*$d );
end</programlisting>

    <para>In this case, the code and balance would be read from the underlying Customer object.
      Likewise, the setAccount will modify the underlying object, preserving a strongly typed access
      to the data structures. A hard field must have the same name and type both in the core class
      and all donned interfaces. The name is used to establish the mapping: if two fields have the
      same name, then they must also have the same declared type. The annotation
      @org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Alias allows to relax this restriction. If an @Alias is
      provided, its value string will be used to resolve mappings instead of the original field
      name. @Alias can be applied both to traits and core beans. </para>
    <programlisting>import org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.*;
declare trait GoldenCustomer
    balance : long @Alias( "org.acme.foo.accountBalance" )
end

declare Person
    name : String
    savings : long @Alias( "org.acme.foo.accountBalance" )
end

when
    GoldenCustomer( balance > 1000 ) // will react to new Person( 2000 )
then
end
</programlisting>
    <para>More work is being done on reaxing this constraint (see the experimental section on
      "logical" traits later). Now, one might wonder what happens when a core class does NOT provide
      the implementation for a field defined in an interface. We call hard fields those trait fields
      which are also core fields and thus readily available, while we define soft those fields which
      are NOT provided by the core class. Hidden fields, instead, are fields in the core class not
      exposed by the interface.</para>

    <para>So, while hard field management is intuitive, there remains the problem of soft and hidden
      fields. Hidden fields are normally only accessible using the core class directly. However, the
      "fields" Map can be used on a trait interface to access a hidden field. If the field can't be
      resolved, null will be returned. Notice that this feature is likely to change in the
      future.</para>
    <programlisting>when
    $sc : GoldenCustomer( fields[ "age" ] > 18 )  // age is declared by the underlying core class, but not by GoldenCustomer
then</programlisting>
    <para>Soft fields, instead, are stored in a Map-like data structure that is specific to each
      core object and referenced by the proxy(es), so that they are effectively shared even when an
      object dons multiple traits.</para>

    <programlisting>when
    $sc : GoldenCustomer( $c : code, // hard getter
                          $maxExpense : maxExpense > 1000 // soft getter
    )
then
    $sc.setDiscount( ... ); // soft setter
end</programlisting>

    <para>A core object also holds a reference to all its proxies, so that it is possible to track
      which type(s) have been added to an object, using a sort of dynamic "instanceof" operator,
      which we called isA. The operator can accept a String, a class literal or a list of class
      literals. In the latter case, the constraint is satisfied only if all the traits have been
      donned. </para>

    <programlisting>$sc : GoldenCustomer( $maxExpense : maxExpense > 1000,
                      this isA "SeniorCustomer", this isA [ NationalCustomer.class, OnlineCustomer.class ]
)</programlisting>

    <para>Eventually, the business logic may require that a trait is removed from a wrapped object.
      To this end, we provide two options. The first is a "logical don", which will result in a
      logical insertion of the proxy resulting from the traiting operation. The TMS will ensure that
      the trait is removed when its logical support is removed in the first place.</para>

    <programlisting>then
    don( $x, // core object
         Customer.class, // trait class
         true // optional flag for logical insertion
    )
    </programlisting>

    <para>The second is the use of the "shed" keyword, which causes the removal of any type that is
      a subtype (or equivalent) of the one passed as an argument. Notice that, as of version 5.5,
      shed would only allow to remove a single specific trait.</para>

    <programlisting>then
    Thing t = shed( $x, GoldenCustomer.class ) // also removes any trait that</programlisting>

    <para>This operation returns another proxy implementing the org.drools.core.factmodel.traits.Thing interface, where
      the getFields() and getCore()
      methods are defined. Internally, in fact, all declared traits are generated to extend this interface (in addition
      to any others specified).
      This allows to preserve the wrapper with the soft fields which would otherwise be lost.</para>
    <para>A trait and its proxies are also correlated in another way. Starting from version 5.6,
      whenever a core object is "modified", its proxies are "modified" automatically as well, to
      allow trait-based patterns to react to potential changes in hard fields. Likewise, whenever a
      trait proxy (matched by a trait pattern) is modified, the modification is propagated to the
      core class and the other traits. Morover, whenever a don operation is performed, the core
      object is also modified automatically, to reevaluate any "isA" operation which may be
      triggered.</para>
    <para>Potentially, this may result in a high number of modifications, impacting performance (and
      correctness) heavily. So, two solutions are currently implemented. First, whenever a core
      object is modified, only the most specific traits (in the sense of inheritance between trait
      interfaces) are updated and an internal blocking mechanism is in place to ensure that each
      potentially matching pattern is evaluated once and only once. So, in the following
      situation:</para>
    <programlisting>declare trait GoldenCustomer end
declare trait NationalGoldenCustomer extends GoldenCustomer end
declare trait SeniorGoldenCustomer extends GoldenCustomer end</programlisting>
    <para>a modification of an object that is both a GoldenCustomer, a NationalGoldenCustomer and a
      SeniorGoldenCustomer would cause only the latter two proxies to be actually modified. The
      first would match any pattern for GoldenCustomer and NationalGoldenCustomer; the latter would
      instead be prevented from rematching GoldenCustomer, but would be allowed to match
      SeniorGoldenCustomer patterns. It is not necessary, instead, to modify the GoldenCustomer
      proxy since it is already covered by at least one other more specific trait.</para>
    <para>The second method, up to the user, is to mark traits as @PropertyReactive. Property
      reactivity is trait-enabled and takes into account the trait field mappings, so to block
      unnecessary propagations. </para>
