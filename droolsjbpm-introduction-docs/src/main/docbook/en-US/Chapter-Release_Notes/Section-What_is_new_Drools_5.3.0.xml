  <title>What is New and Noteworthy in Drools 5.3.0</title>

  <section>
    <title>Drools Expert</title>

    <section>
      <title>Core and Compiler compatility will no longer be maintained</title>
      <para>This is the last release where compatibility in core/compilier and other submodules will be maintained, as we refactor for cleanliness in the following releases. All developers should be using the knowledge-api.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Queries and Backward Chaining</title>

      <para>Queries and Backward Chaining have had extensive bug fixing as it had many cases that didn't work,
      especially with "open" queries. Anyone using backward chaining queries in 5.2 should stop straight away and start
      using this.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Declarative Agenda</title>

      <para>5.3 Introduces the declarative agenda, where rules can be used to control which rules can fire and when.
      While this will add a lot more overhead than the simple use of salience, the advantage is it is declarative and
      thus more readable and maintainable and should allow more use cases to be achieved in a simpler fashion.</para>

      <para>This feature is off by default and must be explicitly enabled, that is because it is considered highly
      experimental for the moment and will be subject to change.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Enabling the Declarative Agenda</title>

        <programlisting>KnowledgeBaseConfiguration kconf = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBaseConfiguration();
kconf.setOption( DeclarativeAgendaOption.ENABLED );
KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase(  kconf );</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The basic idea is:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>All matched rule's Activations are inserted into WorkingMemory as facts. So you can now match against an
          Activation. The rule's metadata and declarations are available as fields on the Activation object.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You can use the kcontext.blockActivation( Activation match ) for the current rule to block the selected
          activation. Only when that rule becomes false will the activation be eligible for firing. If it is already
          eligible for firing and is later blocked, it will be removed from the agenda until it is unblocked.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>An activation may have multiple blockers and a count is kept. All blockers must became false for the
          counter to reach zero to enable the Activation to be eligible for firing.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>kcontext.unblockAllActivations( $a ) is an over-ride rule that will remove all blockers
          regardless</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>An activation may also be cancelled, so it never fires with cancelActivation</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>An unblocked Activation is added to the Agenda and obeys normal salience, agenda groups, ruleflow groups
          etc.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>@activationListener('direct') allows a rule to fire as soon as it's matched, this is to be used for
          rules that block/unblock activations, it is not desirable for these rules to have side effects that impact
          else where. The name may change later, this is actually part of the pluggable terminal node handlers I made,
          which is an "internal" feature for the moment.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <example>
        <title>New RuleContext methods</title>

        <programlisting>void blockActivation(Activation match);
void unblockAllActivations(Activation match);
void cancelActivation(Activation match);</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>Here is a basic example that will block all activations from rules that have metadata @department('sales').
      They will stay blocked until the blockerAllSalesRules rule becomes false, i.e. "go2" is retracted.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Block rules based on rule metadata</title>

        <programlisting>rule rule1 @department('sales') when 
     $s : String( this == 'go1' ) 
then 
    list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s ); 
end 
rule rule2 @department('sales') when 
     $s : String( this == 'go1' ) 
then 
    list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s ); 
end 
rule blockerAllSalesRules @activationListener('direct') when 
     $s : String( this == 'go2' ) 
     $i : Activation( department == 'sales' ) 
then 
    list.add( $i.rule.name + ':' + $s  ); 
    kcontext.blockActivation( $i ); 
end</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>This example shows how you can use active property to count the number of active or inactive (already fired)
      activations.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Count the number of active/inactive Activations</title>

        <programlisting>rule rule1 @department('sales') when 
     $s : String( this == 'go1' ) 
then 
    list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s ); 
end 
rule rule2 @department('sales') when 
     $s : String( this == 'go1' ) 
then 
    list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s ); 
end 
rule rule3 @department('sales') when 
     $s : String( this == 'go1' ) 
then 
    list.add( kcontext.rule.name + ':' + $s ); 
end 
rule countActivateInActive @activationListener('direct') when 
     $s : String( this == 'go2' ) 
     $active : Number( this == 1 ) from accumulate( $a : Activation( department == 'sales', active == true ), count( $a ) )
     $inActive : Number( this == 2 ) from  accumulate( $a : Activation( department == 'sales', active == false ), count( $a ) )
then 
    kcontext.halt( ); 
end </programlisting>
      </example>

      <title>Faster compilation</title>
      <para>Thanks to many improvements and optimizations made on both MVEL
      library and Drools internals, the DRL compilation is now at least 3
      times faster for both MVEL and Java dialects.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Entry-point declarations</title>

      <para>Entry points can now be explicitly declared. Syntax is:</para>

      <para><programlisting>entryPointDeclaration := DECLARE ENTRY-POINT stringId annotation* END</programlisting>Example
      use:<example>
          <programlisting>declare entry-point X
    @doc( "This entry point is receives events from the message queue X" )
end
</programlisting>
        </example></para>
    </section>
<section>
            <title>Traits (experimental)</title>
            <para>A Drools Trait is a bean interface which can be attached - and removed - to and from an individual object at runtime.
            While an object wears a trait, a reference of the trait type is returned, so methods defined in the trait interface can
            be called normally. A trait, then, adds a type and some fields to an object. If a bean has a field of the given name and
            type, that field will be used to support the interface. ''Virtual'' fields, instead, will be stored as entries in a map,
            or as triples in an in-memory store.</para>
            <para>Traits are <literal>declared</literal> with the notation <literal>declare trait</literal>. Unlike normal beans,
            declared traits will generate interfaces instead of classes: the declared fields will be mapped to getters/setters.
            Notice that multiple traits can be worn at the same time.</para>
            <section>
                <title><literal>IsA operator</literal></title>
                <para>The operator isA can be used in patterns to check whether an object is wearing a trait or not</para>
                <para>E.g. <literal>Worker( this isA Student )</literal></para>

      <title>Declarative type extension</title>

      <para>Following the enhancement to Drools Expert type declaration in Guvnor now support 'extends' to inherit from
      super-classes. Sub-classes can extend either other types declared in the same package or imported Java classes. In
      order to extend a type declared in Java by a declared subtype, repeat the supertype in a declare statement without
      any fields.</para>

      <para>Thanks to the help of a community member the tree-view shown in the Knowledge Bases view has been
      improved.</para>

      <para>We also took the opportunity to make a few improvements of our own.</para>

      <itemizedlist>

    <section>
      <title>Asset Viewer</title>

      <para>Guvnor continues to grow and improve with every passing release. One of the requirements we have is to move
      Guvnor away from a pure "Rules" or "Knowledge" repository management and authoring environment to a more generic
      one, in which consumers of different technologies can tailor their experience to their domain's
      requirements.</para>

      <para>One of the more noticeable changes we are making to support this has been to de-couple asset types and
      groups from the code. What was once previously static code is now defined by compile-time configuration. Due to
      limitations in GWT (no client-side reflection), the technology with which Guvnor is implemented, we are
      unfortunately not able to offer runtime configuration at this moment.</para>

      <para>The asset groups are configurable within source file; src/main/resources/drools-asseteditors.xml. This file
      is used at GWT compile time to wire-up asset types with their respective editor, group and group icon. An example
      extract from the foregoing file looks like this:-</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;asseteditor&gt;
    &lt;class&gt;org.drools.guvnor.client.modeldriven.ui.RuleModeller&lt;/class&gt;
    &lt;format&gt;brl&lt;/format&gt;
    &lt;icon&gt;images.ruleAsset()&lt;/icon&gt; &lt;title&gt;constants.BusinessRuleAssets()&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/asseteditor&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>To emphasis the separation, asset groups have become their own "editor" appearing as a tab in Guvnor's main,
      central panel.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Asset Viewer</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Release_Notes/asset-viewer.png" format="PNG" scalefit="1"></imagedata>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The format of the new screen is being tried for 5.3.0.Beta1. There has been some discussion whether a single
      table containing all assets would be better - with collapsible rows to group different types of asset. The
      immediate problem with this approach is however that finding different asset types on a "paged table" becomes more
      cumbersome for the user; as they'd have to sort by type and page through.</para>

      <para>We therefore ask for community feedback.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Guvnor enumeration improvements</title>

      <para>Previously Guvnor enumerations that had a "display value" and a "DRL value" (i.e. the value substituted for
      the display value when DRL was generated) could be defined with "&lt;DRL value&gt;=&lt;Display value&gt;". Various
      community users have been using Guvnor enumerations to support complex rule definitions in both DSL and the guided
      Decision Table editor.</para>

      <programlisting>'Fact.operator' : ['equals=\\=\\=', 'not equals=!\\=']</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Guvnor Guided Decision Table</title>

      <para>A couple of minor enhancements have been made to Guvnor's guided decision table editor:-</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Removal of sorting</para>

          <para>You are now able to restore the original sort order of a column by clicking on the sort icon through:
          ascending, descending and none.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Formulae and Predicates support value lists</para>

          <para>Up until now only literal value columns could take advantage of value lists; either "Guvnor enums" or
          the Decision Table's "Optional value list". This been rectified with this release bringing the advantage of
          predefined choices for these types of fields to the business user.</para>

      <title>Construction heuristics</title>

      <para>As an alternative to writing a long, complex <literal>StartingSolutionInitializer</literal>, you can now
      simply configure a powerful construction heuristic:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;solver&gt;
  ...
  &lt;constructionheuristic&gt;
    &lt;constructionheuristicType&gt;FIRST_FIT&lt;/constructionheuristicType&gt;
  &lt;/constructionheuristic&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Planner already supports:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>First Fit</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>First Fit Decreasing (this is how most of the examples implemented their
          <literal>StartingSolutionInitializer</literal>)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Best Fit</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Best Fit Decreasing</para>
        </listitem>

      <para>Future versions will support more construction heuristics.</para>

      <title>Phasing</title>

      <para>Planner can now run several solver phases sequentially: each phase is a different optimization algorithm.
      For example: run First Fit Decreasing, then Simulated Annealing, then Tabu Search: </para>

      <programlisting>&lt;solver&gt;
  ...
  &lt;constructionheuristic&gt;
    ... &lt;!-- First Fit Decreasing --&gt;
  &lt;/constructionheuristic&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;
    ... &lt;!-- Simulated Annealing --&gt;
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;
    ... &lt;!-- Tabu Search --&gt;
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

      <title>Real-time planning</title>

      <para>Planner now supports real-time planning. Real-time planning means that the planning problem can change up to
      a few milliseconds before a solution needs to be executed.</para>

      <para>If one of the planning facts change while a planning problem is being solved, Planner can now process such a
      planning fact change and incrementally continue from the best solution found before that planning fact change. In
      practice, this means it can find a good solution for a big planning problem only a few milliseconds after a
      planning fact changes.</para>

      <para>Planner's documentation now covers several common techniques such as backup planning, continuous planning
      and real-time planning.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Documentation expanded</title>

      <para>The documentation now includes:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>detailed documentation on planning entity and planning
          variable</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>an optimization algorithms overview</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>guidelines on what's the easiest path to get started</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Info on common pitfalls and solutions</para>
        </listitem>

      <section>
        <title>Event Listeners</title>
        <para>Drools supports adding 3 types of listeners to KnowledgeSessions -
          <emphasis>AgendaListener</emphasis>,
          <emphasis>WorkingMemoryListener</emphasis>,
          <emphasis>ProcessEventListener</emphasis></para>

        <para>The drools-spring module allows you to configure these listeners
        to KnowledgeSessions using XML tags. These tags have identical names as
        the actual listener interfaces i.e.,
        &lt;drools:agendaEventListener....&gt;,
        &lt;drools:workingMemoryEventListener....&gt; and
        &lt;drools:processEventListener....&gt;.</para>

        <para>drools-spring provides features to define the listeners as
        standalone (individual) listeners and also to define them as a
        group.</para>
