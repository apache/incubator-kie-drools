= Type declarations without metadata in DRL

A declaration of a new fact does not require any metadata, but must include a list of attributes or fields. If a type declaration does not include identifying attributes, the {DECISION_ENGINE} searches for an existing fact class in the classpath and raises an error if the class is missing.

The following example is a declaration of a new fact type `Person` with no metadata in a DRL file:

.Example declaration of a new fact type with a rule
[source]
----
declare Person
  name : String
  dateOfBirth : java.util.Date
  address : Address
end

rule "Using a declared type"
  when
    $p : Person( name == "James" )
  then   // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James.
    Person mark = new Person();
    mark.setName( "Mark" );
    insert( mark );
end
----

In this example, the new fact type `Person` has the three attributes `name`, `dateOfBirth`, and `address`. Each attribute has a type that can be any valid Java type, including another class that you create or a fact type that you previously declared. The `dateOfBirth` attribute has the type `java.util.Date`, from the Java API, and the `address` attribute has the previously defined fact type `Address`.

To avoid writing the fully qualified name of a class every time you declare it, you can define the full class name as part of the `import` clause:

.Example type declaration with the fully qualified class name in the import
[source]
----
import java.util.Date

declare Person
    name : String
    dateOfBirth : Date
    address : Address
end
----

When you declare a new fact type, the {DECISION_ENGINE} generates at compile time a Java class representing the fact type. The generated Java class is a one-to-one JavaBeans mapping of the type definition.

For example, the following Java class is generated from the example `Person` type declaration:

.Generated Java class for the Person fact type declaration
[source,java]
----
public class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private java.util.Date dateOfBirth;
    private Address address;

    // Empty constructor
    public Person() {...}

    // Constructor with all fields
    public Person( String name, Date dateOfBirth, Address address ) {...}

    // If keys are defined, constructor with keys
    public Person( ...keys... ) {...}

    // Getters and setters
    // `equals` and `hashCode`
    // `toString`
}
----

You can then use the generated class in your rules like any other fact, as illustrated in the previous rule example with the `Person` type declaration:

.Example rule that uses the declared Person fact type
[source]
----
rule "Using a declared type"
  when
    $p : Person( name == "James" )
  then   // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James.
    Person mark = new Person();
    mark.setName( "Mark" );
    insert( mark );
end
----
