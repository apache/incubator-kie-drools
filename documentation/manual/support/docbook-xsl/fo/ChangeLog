2005-12-29  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autotoc.xsl, component.xsl, division.xsl, sections.xsl:

2005-12-19  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autoidx.xsl: Added missing variable declaration

2005-12-14  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* titlepage.xsl: Removed obsolete template match="legalnotice/title" mode="titlepage.legalnotice.title.mode".

2005-12-13  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	separator punctuation based on locale.

2005-11-20  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* axf.xsl: Added normalize-space() to text values in document properties.
	Handle author better, the same as xep.xsl.

	* verbatim.xsl: Fixed bug in startinglinenumber when programlisting
	is inside a programlistingco.

	* xep.xsl: Added normalize-space() to text values in document properties.

2005-11-14  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* synop.xsl: Added handling for cases of Methodsynopsis that have Modifier
	instances after the Methodname. Closes #1353365; thanks to
	Stephen Langer for reporting.

2005-11-09  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* synop.xsl: Added support for link, olink, and xref within OO Classsynopsis
	and children. (Because DocBook NG/5 allows it).

2005-11-07  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xref.xsl: Fixed 'nopage' option in xrefstyle.

2005-11-02  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-10-20  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docbook.xsl, passivetex.xsl, spaces.xsl: Map Unicode space characters U+2000-U+200A to fo:leaders.

2005-10-17  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fo.xsl: Output a real em dash for em-dash dingbat (instead of two hypens).

	* lists.xsl: Problem:
	In a PDF generated with Passivetex, every itemizedlist (bulleted
	list) has a linebreak after the bullet and before the listem
	contents. That bullet should not be there.
	
	Cause:
	Design problem in Passivetex
	
	Fix:
	Added a fix that works around the problem by not wrapping the
	listem output in an <fo:block> if passivetex.extensions=1. Closes
	#1328348.
	
	Affects:
	Only affects output if passivetex.extensions=1. Otherwise,
	follows previous code path, so behavior is exactly the same.

2005-10-12  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glossary.xsl: Fixed bug #1315700, where glossary in part with role="auto"
	produced invalid FO.

2005-10-06  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docbook.xsl: Move the stripns code to a common location; update @fileref and @entityref attributes in an attempt to handle the fact that the base URI gets mangled by the stripping copy.

2005-10-06  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lists.xsl: Corrected minor copy-paste error (orderedlist template picking up
	value of itemizedlist.label.width instead of orderedlist.label.width).

2005-10-05  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lists.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: Support default label width parameters for itemized and ordered lists

	* synop.xsl: Comment out debugging message

2005-09-29  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autoidx.xsl: Added parameters to support localization of index item
	punctuation.

	* param.ent: Added index.number.separator, index.range.separator, and
	index.term.separator parameters to support localization
	of punctuation in index entries.

2005-09-29  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* param.xweb: Added "Cross References" section in HTML doc (for consistency with
	the FO doc). Also, moved the existing FO "Cross References"
	section to follow the "Linking" section.

	* param.xweb: Added ID attribues to all Reference elements (e.g., id="tables"
	for the doc for section on Table params). So pages for all
	subsections of ref docs now have stable filenames instead of
	arbitrary generated filenames.

2005-09-29  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* param.xweb: Added index.number.separator, index.range.separator, and
	index.term.separator parameters to support localization
	of punctuation in index entries.

2005-09-29  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* refentry.xsl, synop.xsl: Generate localized title for Refsynopsisdiv if no appropriate
	Title descendant found in source. Closes #1212398. This change
	makes behavior for the Synopsis title consistent with the behavior
	of HTML and manpages output.
	
	Also, added xsl:use-attribute-sets="normal.para.spacing" to block
	generated for Cmdsynopsis output. Previously, that block had no
	spacing at all specified, which resulted it being crammed up to
	closely to the Synopsis head.

2005-09-28  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lists.xsl: Removed misguided code intended for normalizing whitespace in term
	output for HTML and FO. (It's not necessary for those, though it is
	still needed in manpages output because we're using the .TP macro,
	and first line following that is treated differently than the
	subsequent lines. So we need to get rid of any embedded line
	breaks from within the Term source.)

	* lists.xsl: Added two new parameters for handling of multi-term varlistentry
	elements:
	
	variablelist.term.break.after:
	  When the variablelist.term.break.after is non-zero, it will
	  generate a line break after each term multi-term varlistentry.
	
	variablelist.term.separator:
	  When a varlistentry contains multiple term elements, the string
	  specified in the value of the variablelist.term.separator
	  parameter is placed after each term except the last. The default
	  is ", " (a comma followed by a space). To suppress rendering of
	  the separator, set the value of variablelist.term.separator to
	  the empty string ("").
	
	These parameters are primarily intended to be useful if you have
	multi-term varlistentries that have long terms.
	
	Closes #1306676. Thanks to Sam Steingold for providing an example
	"lots of long terms" doc that demonstrated the value of having
	these options.
	
	Also, added normalize-space() call to processing of each term.
	
	This change affects all output formats (HTML, PDF, manpages). The
	default behavior should pretty much remain the same as before, but
	it is possible (as always) that the change may introduce some new
	bugginess.

2005-09-28  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pagesetup.xsl: Fixed bug #1306070 set with 2 books: wrong page numbering on 2nd book.

2005-09-28  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* param.ent, param.xweb: Added two new parameters for handling of multi-term varlistentry
	elements:
	
	variablelist.term.break.after:
	  When the variablelist.term.break.after is non-zero, it will
	  generate a line break after each term multi-term varlistentry.
	
	variablelist.term.separator:
	  When a varlistentry contains multiple term elements, the string
	  specified in the value of the variablelist.term.separator
	  parameter is placed after each term except the last. The default
	  is ", " (a comma followed by a space). To suppress rendering of
	  the separator, set the value of variablelist.term.separator to
	  the empty string ("").
	
	These parameters are primarily intended to be useful if you have
	multi-term varlistentries that have long terms.
	
	Closes #1306676. Thanks to Sam Steingold for providing an example
	"lots of long terms" doc that demonstrated the value of having
	these options.
	
	Also, added normalize-space() call to processing of each term.
	
	This change affects all output formats (HTML, PDF, manpages). The
	default behavior should pretty much remain the same as before, but
	it is possible (as always) that the change may introduce some new
	bugginess.

2005-09-25  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* block.xsl: Fixed bug [ 1256277 ] sidebarinfo not supported, so now sidebarinfo
	is supported.

	* sections.xsl: Fixed incorrect variable name.

	* titlepage.templates.xml: Add titlepage for sidebar.

	* titlepage.xsl: Add sidebar titlepage placeholder attset for styles.

	* xref.xsl: Moved olink page citation template to xref.xsl.

2005-09-24  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sections.xsl: Fixed bug [ 1261896 ] Section title's footnotes in page header.

2005-09-21  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pagesetup.xsl: Fixed set.flow.properties to match on draft page-masters too.

2005-09-20  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lists.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: Implemented RFE #1292615.
	
	Added bunch of new parameters (attribute sets) that affect list presentation: list.block.properties, itemizedlist.properties, orderedlist.properties, itemizedlist.label.properties and orderedlist.label.properties. Default behaviour of stylesheets has not been changed but further customizations will be much more easier.

2005-09-16  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docbook.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb, xep.xsl: Implemented RFE #1242092.
	
	You can enable crop marks in your document by setting crop.marks=1 and xep.extensions=1.
	Appearance of crop marks can be controlled by parameters crop.mark.bleed (6pt), crop.mark.offset (24pt) and crop.mark.width (0.5pt).
	
	Also there is new named template called user-xep-pis. You can overwrite it in order to produce some PIs that can control XEP as described in http://www.renderx.com/reference.html#Output_Formats

2005-09-09  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.xsl: arbortext.extensions supports the url(...) syntax.

2005-09-07  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autotoc.xsl: Appendixes inside article are considered for ToC

2005-09-01  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* division.xsl: Process not only subelements of book, but all content including PI (possibly custom).

2005-08-16  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* table.xsl: Fixed bug in char attribute, where text-align was being set to
	any char value, even if the align attribute was not 'char'.
	The CALS spec says text-align set to the value of char only
	if the align attribute is 'char'.

2005-08-09  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autoidx.xsl: Fix bug 1247565: missing attribute set on symbol entries.

	* block.xsl, ebnf.xsl, table.xsl, titlepage.xsl: fo:table-body and fo:table-header now set start-indent and
	end-indent to zero to reset the table reference areas.

2005-08-05  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autoidx.xsl: Fixed bug #1244478. Indexterms in informal objects are now getting correct page reference.

2005-07-27  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pagesetup.xsl: Fixed starting page number for first part element in single-sided output.

2005-07-09  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.xsl: Applied patch #850001 to add content-type property to
	external-graphic element based on imagedata format attribute.

2005-06-28  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xep.xsl: Added support for generating <rx:meta-field creator="foo"/> field
	for XEP. Also, added support for picking up and using contents of
	<corpauthor> for XEP <rx:meta-field author="foo"/> field.

2005-06-28  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xref.xsl: Moved the fo:basic-link for page refs to the page.citation template
	so it can be more easily customized.
	Fixed bug in using page keyword in role used as xrefstyle.

2005-06-27  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* param.xweb: Doc tweak to match user/developer distinction.

2005-06-27  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* qandaset.xsl: Removed the start-indent on qandadiv because it conflicts with
	other indents, and that style should be implemented with
	a property set.

2005-06-13  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* inline.xsl: Trademark symbol handling made consistent with handling of same in
	HTML stylesheets. (closes #1218286; thanks to Mauritz Jeanson for
	reporting the problem)
	
	Prior to this change, if you processed a doc that contained no
	value for the Class attribute on the Trademark element, the HTML
	stylesheets would default to rendering a superscript TM symbol
	after the Trademark contents, but the FO stylesheets would render
	nothing. This change alters the FO handing of Trademark such that
	it is now identical to the HTML handling.

2005-06-01  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* refentry.xsl, titlepage.xsl: Corrected formatting of generated "Name" title in refentry output
	(closes #1212396; thanks to Andreas Lalloo for reporting the
	problem).
	
	:Problem::
	The "Name" title generated for FO output of Refnamediv in Refentry
	is not aligned flush left, as all the other subheadings of
	Refentry are, and as the generated Name subheading for Refentry is
	in HTML output. Also, the Name title is in a larger font size than
	the titles of the other first-level children of Refentry.
	
	:Fix::
	The "Name" title generated for FO output of Refnamediv in Refentry
	is now handled using the same formatting as that used for all
	other first-level children of Refentry.
	
	::Affects:
	Along with affecting processing for generated titles for
	Refnamediv in FO output, it is possible that this change may have
	unanticipated side effects on processing of titles for
	Refsynopsisdiv, Refsection, and Refsect1 to Refsect3. The reason
	is that part of this change takes the template contents formerly
	used only for processing Refsynopsisdiv, Refsection, and Refsect1
	to Refsect3, and "repurposes" those template contents for use in
	processing the generated title for Refnamediv.

	* xep.xsl: Generate XEP bookmarks for Refentry children. (closes #1212491)
	
	Titled child sections of Refentry (Refsynosisdiv, Refsection, and
	Refsect1 to Refsect3) were not included in the match statement
	used for generating XEP bookmarks. Don't know whether that was
	intentional for some reason or whether it was just an oversight.
	But given that both AXF and Passivetex bookmarks are generated for
	those same Refentry children, it seems like XEP ones ought to also
	be generated, for the sake of consistency if for no other reason.

2005-05-31  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* table.xsl: Add support for HTML markup table border attribute, applied to each table cell.

	* table.xsl: The table.width template can now sum column specs if none use % or *.

2005-05-27  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* param.ent, param.xweb: Added references to newly added parameter l10n.gentext.use.xref.language

2005-05-25  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lists.xsl: Set start-indent and end-indent for fo:table-body used to format lists to
	zero so that they do not inherit any start-indent from their container, which
	would indent relative to the cell boundary.

2005-05-24  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lists.xsl: Support generation of choice separator in inline simplelist
	(closes #1207532)
	
	This ehancement enables auto-generation of an appropriate
	localized "choice separator" (for example, "and" or
	"or") before the final item in an inline simplelist.
	
	To indicate that you want a choice separator generated
	for a particular list, you need to put a processing
	instruction (PI) of the form <?dbchoice choice="foo"?>
	as a child a of the list. For example:
	
	  <para>This release adds localiation support for the
	  following Indic languages:
	    <simplelist type="inline">
	      <?dbchoice choice="and" ?>
	      <member>Hindi</member>
	      <member>Punjabi</member>
	      <member>Tamil</member>
	      <member>Oriya</member>
	      <member>Gujarati</member>
	    </simplelist>.
	  </para>
	
	Output (for English):
	
	  This release adds localiation support for the
	  following Indic languages: Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil,
	  Oriya, and Gujarati.
	
	Or if the logical relationship between the items in the
	list is an "or" relationship, then use choice="or":
	
	  <para>Choose from ONE and ONLY ONE of the following:
	    <simplelist type="inline">
	      <?dbchoice choice="or" ?>
	      <member>A</member>
	      <member>B</member>
	      <member>C</member>.
	    </simplelist>
	  </para>
	
	Output (for English):
	
	  Choose from ONE and only ONE of the
	  following choices: A, B, or C.
	
	As a temporary workaround for the fact that most of the
	DocBook non-English locale files don't have a
	localization for the word "or", you can put in a
	literal string to be used; example for French:
	
	  <para>Choose from ONE and ONLY ONE of the following:
	    <simplelist type="inline">
	      <?dbchoice choice="ou" ?>
	      <member>A</member>
	      <member>B</member>
	      <member>C</member>.
	    </simplelist>
	  </para>
	
	That is, use "ou" instead of "or".

	linking to internal destinations.

2005-04-16  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* inline.xsl: The application of the menuchoice separator parameters
	now  uses xsl:copy-of instead of xsl:value-of
	so something more complex than a string can be used.

2005-04-15  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* block.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: Add support for customizing abstract with property sets.

	Remove it if AH decides to support fo:wrapper as the link target.

2005-04-07  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* admon.xsl, formal.xsl, htmltbl.xsl, titlepage.templates.xml, titlepage.xsl:

	* lists.xsl: bug #1007414 & patch #971730 - passivetex outputs "* 0.60 + 1em"
	garbage in lists (reported by Alex Roitman and James William Pye)
	
	::PROBLEM
	  Literal stuff "* 0.60 + 1em" showing up in listitem PDF output
	  generated through passivetex
	
	::CAUSE
	  Logic that outputs non-constant size expressions like "4em *
	  0.60 + 1em" was added to stylesheets to improve look of list
	  formatting. But passivetex can only handle constant sizes; so,
	  instead of doing the math, it spits out the literal expressions
	  in output.
	
	::FIX
	  Added workaround - some conditional logic to fall back to
	  constant values if passivetex.extensions param is non-zero.
	
	::AFFECTED AREAS
	  Should only affect FO output when passivetex.extensions is non-zero

	Updated master-name/master-reference per the XSL 1.0 Recommendation

2001-11-15  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docbook.xsl, passivetex.xsl: When passivetex.extensions=1 character &#x200b; is inserted between all occurences of --. This stops TeX ligature mechanism which converted all -- to endash and --- to emdash (this is ill especially in source code listings containing XML comments or decrementation operator). Performance cost of evaluating condition for each text node is under 5 %. This shouldn't annoy anyone.

2001-11-12  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-08-02  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xref.xsl: Changed <xref> with endterm to process the children nodes
	and not just the text by calling a new mode="endterm" template.
	
	Also changed <link> to process its endterm if the element content
	is empty.
	
	Also changed the first use of name() to local-name() to
