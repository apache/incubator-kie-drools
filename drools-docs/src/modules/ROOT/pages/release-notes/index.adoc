== Drools 10-series release notes

=== Minimum requirements update

JDK 17 is now the minimum Java version required to compile Drools and make use of Drools.

Maven `3.8.6` is the minimum Maven version required to build Drools from source, or using `kie-ci` APIs.

=== `drools-mvel` and `drools-engine-classic` are deprecated

`drools-mvel` is deprecated since Drools 8 in favor of the executable model. It also means drools-engine` is recommended instead of deprecated `drools-engine-classic` that contains `drools-mvel`. You can still use MVEL syntax in your rules, so it doesn't affect how to write rules.
