2006-02-28  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* biblio.xsl: Content of citation element is automatically linked to the bibliographic entry with the corresponding abbrev.

2006-02-28  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.xsl: Process alt text with normalize-space().
	Replace tab indents with spaces.

2006-02-28  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* inline.xsl, xref.xsl: Content of citation element is automatically linked to the bibliographic entry with the corresponding abbrev.

2006-02-09  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xref.xsl: Add template for task in mode="xref-to".

2005-12-14  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* html.xsl: Suppress ID warnings if the .warnings parameter is 0

2005-12-13  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* formal.xsl: Add support for floatstyle to figure.

2005-12-01  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xref.xsl: Handling of xref to area/areaset need support in extensions code also. I currently have no time to touch extensions code, so code is here to be enabled when extension is fixed also.

2005-11-24  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autoidx.xsl: Added parameters to support localization of index item
	punctuation.
	Added index.separator named template to compute the
	separator punctuation based on locale.

	* param.ent, param.xweb: Added 3 parameters for overriding gentext for
	index punctuation.

2005-11-21  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* formal.xsl: Added a <div class="{$class}-contents"> wrapper around output of
	contents of all formal objects. Also, added an optional
	<br class="{class}-break"/> linebreak after all formal objects.
	
	WARNING: Because this change places an additional DIV between the
	DIV wrapper for the equation and the equation contents, it may
	break some existing CSS stylesheets that have been created with
	the assumption that there would never be an intervening DIV there.
	
	The following is an example of what Equation output looks like as
	a result of the changes described above.
	
	  <div class="equation">
	    <a name="three" id="three"></a>
	
	    <p class="title"><b>(1.3)</b></p>
	
	    <div class="equation-contents">
	      <span class="mathphrase">1+1=3</span>
	    </div>
	  </div><br class="equation-break">
	
	Rationale: These changes allow CSS control of the placement of the
	formal-object title relative to the formal-object contents. For
	example, using the CSS "float" property enables the title and
	contents to be rendered on the same line. Example stylesheet:
	
	  .equation {
	    margin-top: 20px;
	    margin-bottom: 20px;
	  }
	  .equation-contents {
	    float: left;
	  }
	
	  .equation .title {
	    margin-top: 0;
	    float: right;
	    margin-right: 200px;
	  }
	
	  .equation .title b {
	    font-weight: normal;
	  }
	
	  .equation-break {
	    clear: both;
	  }
	
	Note that the purpose of the ".equation-break" class is to provide
	a way to clear off the floats.
	
	If you want to instead have the equation title rendered to the left
	of the equation contents, you can do something like this:
	
	  .equation {
	    margin-top: 20px;
	    width: 300px;
	    margin-bottom: 20px;
	  }
	  .equation-contents {
	    float: right;
	  }
	
	  .equation .title {
	    margin-top: 0;
	    float: left;
	    margin-right: 200px;
	  }
	
	  .equation .title b {
	    font-weight: normal;
	  }
	
	  .equation-break {
	    clear: both;
	  }

2005-11-20  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* verbatim.xsl: Fixed bug in startinglinenumber when context is
	programlistingco.

2005-11-14  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* synop.xsl: Added handling for cases of Methodsynopsis that have Modifier
	instances after the Methodname. Closes #1353365; thanks to
	Stephen Langer for reporting.

2005-11-09  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chunker.xsl: Added a chunker.output.quiet top-level parameter so that the chunker can be made quiet by default

2005-11-09  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* synop.xsl: Added support for link, olink, and xref within OO Classsynopsis
	and children. (Because DocBook NG/5 allows it).

2005-10-29  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* db5strip.xsl: New file.

2005-10-29  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* html.xsl: For case where id.warn

	* html.xsl: Changed check for *info child in id.warning template from using
	contains() to using ends-with() -- because contains() will match
	informal* elements (informaltable, etc) too -- not just *info
	elements.
	
	Also added check to make sure that *info element matched actually
	has a title (because some *info elements may not -- title is not a
	required child of *info elements).
	
	And FWIW, I don't think it is too aggressive to have the default
	behavior be to have the stylesheets emit notification messages
	about ID-less titled objects. If it were the default to have it
	not emit those, most users would probably never take the time to
	turn it on, including the users who it is most meant to benefit
	(those who don't yet know why they ought to be putting IDs on
	their titled objects).

2005-10-29  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* html.xsl: ends-with() isn't an XSLT 1.0 function

2005-10-28  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* biblio.xsl, component.xsl, division.xsl, formal.xsl, glossary.xsl, html.xsl, index.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb, refentry.xsl, sections.xsl: 
	New parameter: id.warnings. If non-zero, warnings are generated for titled objects that don't have titles. True by default; I wonder if this will be too aggressive?

2005-10-27  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.xsl: If the keep.relative.image.uris parameter is true, don't use the absolute URI (as calculated from xml:base) in the img src attribute, us the value the author specified. Note that we still have to calculate the absolute filename for use in the image intrinsics extension.

	* inline.xsl: Support date as an inline

	* param.ent, param.xweb: Added new parameter keep.relative.image.uris

	* synop.xsl: Hack font bugs in funcsynopses

2005-10-06  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docbook.xsl: Move the stripns code to a common location; update @fileref and @entityref attributes in an attempt to handle the fact that the base URI gets mangled by the stripping copy.

2005-09-29  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* param.xweb: Added "Cross References" section in HTML doc (for consistency with
	the FO doc). Also, moved the existing FO "Cross References"
	section to follow the "Linking" section.

	* param.xweb: Added ID attribues to all Reference elements (e.g., id="tables"
	for the doc for section on Table params). So pages for all
	subsections of ref docs now have stable filenames instead of
	arbitrary generated filenames.

2005-09-28  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* html.xsl: Problem:
	Garbage characters appear in content of Title attribute in HTML
	output.
	
	Cause:
	Contents of Alt element, including line breaks, were being copied
	over "as is" to value of Title attribute in HTML output. Line
	breaks in Title appear a garbage characters when displayed as
	pop-up "tool text".
	
	Fix:
	Added call to normalize-space() when transforming content of Alt
	for HTML output. Closes #1254532. Thanks to Sam Steingold for
	reporting the problem.

	* lists.xsl: Removed misguided code intended for normalizing whitespace in term
	output for HTML and FO. (It's not necessary for those, though it is
	still needed in manpages output because we're using the .TP macro,
	and first line following that is treated differently than the
	subsequent lines. So we need to get rid of any embedded line
	breaks from within the Term source.)

	* lists.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: Added two new parameters for handling of multi-term varlistentry
	elements:
	
	variablelist.term.break.after:
	  When the variablelist.term.break.after is non-zero, it will
	  generate a line break after each term multi-term varlistentry.
	
	variablelist.term.separator:
	  When a varlistentry contains multiple term elements, the string
	  specified in the value of the variablelist.term.separator
	  parameter is placed after each term except the last. The default
	  is ", " (a comma followed by a space). To suppress rendering of
	  the separator, set the value of variablelist.term.separator to
	  the empty string ("").
	
	These parameters are primarily intended to be useful if you have
	multi-term varlistentries that have long terms.
	
	Closes #1306676. Thanks to Sam Steingold for providing an example
	"lots of long terms" doc that demonstrated the value of having
	these options.
	
	Also, added normalize-space() call to processing of each term.
	
	This change affects all output formats (HTML, PDF, manpages). The
	default behavior should pretty much remain the same as before, but
	it is possible (as always) that the change may introduce some new
	bugginess.

2005-09-27  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* inline.xsl: Added "wrapper-name" param to inline.charseq named template,
	enabling it to output inlines other than just "span". Acronym and
	Abbrev templates now use inline.charseq to output HTML "acronym"
	and "abbr" elements (instead of "span"). Closes #1305468. Thanks
	to Sam Steingold for suggesting the change.

2005-09-25  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* qandaset.xsl: Fixed bug [ 1292052 ] acronym/remark in qandaentry/question TOC.

2005-09-24  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* qandaset.xsl: Fixed bug [ 1261811 ] Redundant output of b and anchor element with identical id.

2005-09-12  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* qandaset.xsl: Removed colspan on tr elements since it is invalid and
	already on the td anyway.  Fixes bug 1261832.

2005-09-11  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* table.xsl: Can you say infinite loop? I knew you could.

2005-08-28  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chunker.xsl: Changed version attribute on xsl:stylesheet from 1.1 to 1.0

2005-08-24  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* block.xsl, component.xsl, division.xsl, html.xsl, inline.xsl, refentry.xsl, sections.xsl: 
	Attempt to support @dir more effectively

2005-08-11  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* annotations.xsl: Set default value of annotation.support param to 0 (off). Also,
	wrapped contents of the apply-annotations template in a "if"
	statement, so that those contents get evaluated only if
	annotation.support is non-zero.
	
	The reason for these changes was a report from Doug du Boulay (on
	the docbook-apps list) that processing of the apply-annotations
	template was consuming 75% of the total processing time for a
	2.5Mb file. Anatoly Techtonik followed with a comment that with
	1.69.0, "Compiling took about full working day on 12Mb file while
	earlier it was about 2-4 hours".

2005-08-04  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chunk-code.xsl, chunkfast.xsl: Add cf to exclude-result-prefixes because it is for internal use only.

2005-07-14  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* annotations.xsl, chunk-code.xsl, docbook.xsl, footnote.xsl, inline.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: 
	Added a first cut at support for DocBook 5 style annotations

	* docbook.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: Added parameter for the annotation CSS

2005-07-11  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* component.xsl: Removed obsolete templates using mode="component.number".

2005-07-10  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* division.xsl, titlepage.templates.xml: Fixed missing "Part n." label for part titles.

2005-06-28  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile: "clean" target no longer deletes html/profile-chunk.xsl or
	html/profile-onechunk.xsl
	Those files are under version control, not made. So they should
	not be deleted by the build.

2005-06-24  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* html.xsl, inline.xsl: Added initial, EXPERIMENTAL support for generating content for
	HTML "title" attributes from content of the Alt element.
	
	This change adds support for generating HTML "title" attributes
	for the following inline elements only (all inlines -- support for
	block elements will need to wait for later).
	
	  abbrev accel acronym action application authorinitials beginpage
	  citation citerefentry citetitle city classname code command
	  comment computeroutput constant country database email envar
	  errorcode errorname errortext errortype exceptionname fax
	  filename firstname firstterm foreignphrase function glossterm
	  guibutton guiicon guilabel guimenu guimenuitem guisubmenu
	  hardware honorific interface interfacedefinition interfacename
	  keycap keycode keysym lineage lineannotation literal markup
	  medialabel methodname mousebutton option optional otheraddr
	  othername package parameter personname phone pob postcode
	  productname productnumber prompt property quote refentrytitle
	  remark replaceable returnvalue sgmltag shortcut state street
	  structfield structname subscript superscript surname symbol
	  systemitem tag termdef token trademark type uri userinput
	  varname wordasword
	
	Implemented by creating a new named template, generate.html.title.
	That is is currently called in eleven places only, in the
	inline.xsl file. But it's called by all the inline.* templates
	(e.g., inline.boldseq), which in turn are called by other
	(element) templates, so it results, currently, in supporting
	generation of the HTML "title" attribute for a total of about 93
	elements (the list above).

	* param.ent, param.xweb, titlepage.xsl: Added support for chunking revhistory into separate file (similar
	to the support for doing same with legalnotice). Patch from Thomas
	Schraitle (closes #1096574). Controlled through new
	generate.revhistory.link parameter.

	* refentry.xsl: Applied patch from Anatoly Techtonik to correct problem of
	multiple name attributes generated for output of Reference element
	(closes #1226390)

2005-06-03  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chunk-code.xsl, chunkfast.xsl: Fixed bug [ 1212159 ] Missing navigational links with XHTML chunking
	which was caused by the following:
	
	1.  When chunk.hierarchy is created, it is a collection of
	div elements in a variable, and then that is converted to a
	node-set by exlt.
	
	2.  In HTML, there is no namespace, so the div elements are in
	no namespace and they work.
	
	3.  In XHTML, the div elements are in the xhtml namespace because
	it is the default namespace.  So they cannot be addressed as
	just "div", they must have a namespace prefix.
	
	4.  I added an explicit chunkfast namespace to avoid conflict
	with the default namespace.

2005-06-02  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* table.xsl: Backed out patch for #1211477 because it breaks table processing in Saxon.

2005-06-01  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* table.xsl: Applied patch from David Green for #1211477, to prevent
	StackOverflowError encountered when processing tables with ~700
	rows with Xalan. Smoke-tested and didn't see any obvious problems
	with the fix, so going ahead and committing it so others can test
	with snapshot.

2005-05-31  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chunktoc.xsl: Fixed bug #1202971, chunktoc doesn't handle the chunk.tocs.and.lots=1
	parameter.

2005-05-26  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chunk-common.xsl, manifest.xsl: Fixed bug #851598 links to legalnotice in html are broken.

2005-05-26  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* param.ent, param.xweb: Make language codes RFC compliant (closes #1208931; thanks to
	Bernd Groh for reporting).
	
	::PROBLEM:
	  Stylesheets output two-part language codes in the form "zh_CN".
	  But underscores in language codes are actually neither RFC
	  compliant nor compliant with the HTML 4.0 rec. The separator
	  should be a hyphen. To quote the specs:
	
	    Section 8.1.1, "Language Codes"[1], in the HTML 4.0 Rec.
	    states that:
	
	    [RFC1766] defines and explains the language codes that MUST be
	    used in HTML documents.
	
	    Briefly, language codes consist of a primary code and a
	    possibly empty series of subcodes:
	
	      language-code = primary-code ( "-" subcode )*
	
	    And in RFC 1766, "Tags for the Identification of
	    Languages"[2], the EBNF for "language tag" is given as:
	
	      Language-Tag = Primary-tag *( "-" Subtag )
	      Primary-tag = 1*8ALPHA
	      Subtag = 1*8ALPHA
	
	    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1.1
	    [2] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1766.txt
	
	::CAUSE:
	  Stylesheets simply pass through language codes unaltered. So if
	  users put "zh_CN" in their source, they will get "zh_CN" in
	  their HTML output.
	
	::FIX:
	  Added a new boolean config parameter, "l10n.lang.value.rfc.compliant",
	  set to 1 by default. If it is non-zero, any underscore in a
	  language code will be converted to a hyphen in HTML output. If
	  it is zero, the language code will be left as-is.
	
	::AFFECTS:
	  This change affects any HTML output that contains two-part
	  language codes.

2005-05-26  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* titlepage.xsl: Fixed bug #851598 links to legalnotice in html are broken.

2005-05-24  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lists.xsl: Support generation of choice separator in inline simplelist
	(closes #1207532)
	
	This ehancement enables auto-generation of an appropriate
	localized "choice separator" (for example, "and" or
	"or") before the final item in an inline simplelist.
	
	To indicate that you want a choice separator generated
	for a particular list, you need to put a processing
	instruction (PI) of the form <?dbchoice choice="foo"?>
	as a child a of the list. For example:
	
	  <para>This release adds localiation support for the
	  following Indic languages:
	    <simplelist type="inline">
	      <?dbchoice choice="and" ?>
	      <member>Hindi</member>
	      <member>Punjabi</member>
	      <member>Tamil</member>
	      <member>Oriya</member>
	      <member>Gujarati</member>
	    </simplelist>.
	  </para>
	
	Output (for English):
	
	  This release adds localiation support for the
	  following Indic languages: Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil,
	  Oriya, and Gujarati.
	
	Or if the logical relationship between the items in the
	list is an "or" relationship, then use choice="or":
	
	  <para>Choose from ONE and ONLY ONE of the following:
	    <simplelist type="inline">
	      <?dbchoice choice="or" ?>
	      <member>A</member>
	      <member>B</member>
	      <member>C</member>.
	    </simplelist>
	  </para>
	
	Output (for English):
	
	  Choose from ONE and only ONE of the
	  following choices: A, B, or C.
	
	As a temporary workaround for the fact that most of the
	DocBook non-English locale files don't have a
	localization for the word "or", you can put in a
	literal string to be used; example for French:
	
	  <para>Choose from ONE and ONLY ONE of the following:
	    <simplelist type="inline">
	      <?dbchoice choice="ou" ?>
	      <member>A</member>
	      <member>B</member>
	      <member>C</member>.
	    </simplelist>
	  </para>
	
	That is, use "ou" instead of "or".

2005-05-16  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.xsl: Fixed bug 1201333 mediaobjectco images not aligned.

	* table.xsl: Fixed bug [ 1173576 ] rowsep lines after last row of a table

2005-05-13  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glossary.xsl: Now glosssee and glossseealso use full gentext template with substitution.

2005-05-10  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* synop.xsl: Partially support having multiple parameters in one paramdef.
	DocBook says it is valid, but it's not clear why anybody would
	ever want to do it. Prior to this fix, each parameter would get
	rendered twice. There is still a problem with whitespace between
	parameters getting dropped, but it's not worth fixing unless
	somebody can actually show a use case for having multiple
	parameters in one paramdef.

	* synop.xsl: make funcsynopsis.decoration=1 have effect for nontabular K&R
	output (closes bug # 1198960)
	
	::PROBLEM
	  If you set the funcsynopsis.decoration param to 1 and generate
	  notablular K&R output for a functionsynopsis, the parameters in
	  the function argument synopsis are not styled (italicized) as
	  they are for K&R tabular output.
	
	::FIX
	  Changed K&R nontabular logic to base styling for function
	  argument synopsis on value of funcsynopsis.decoration.

2005-05-09  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* index.xsl: Problem:
	  Invalid HTML generated for manually created Indexes that lack
	  Indexdivs.
	Cause:
	  The indexentry template assumes a dl wrapper has been generated,
	  but the dl wrapper gets generated only if an Indexdiv exists.
	Fix:
	  For Indexes that lack Indexdiv, generate a dl wrapper before
	  processing Indexentries (closes bug ##1196670; thanks to Petr
	  Pajas for reporting the problem).
	Affects:
	  HTML output for manually created Indexes; has no effect on
	  processing of automatically generated Indexes.

2005-05-07  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xref.xsl: Added basic support for biblioref cross referencing.

2005-05-06  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.xsl: Bug fix if caption align.

	* graphics.xsl: Added support for @align on caption in mediaobject.

2005-04-29  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docbook.xsl: 'Support' DocBook V5 namespace

2005-04-28  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.xsl: Support img.src.path PI (is this a good idea?); support (not currently valid) xlink:href on area and (not currently valid) alt in area

2005-04-21  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.xsl: Generate client-side image map for imageobjectco with areas using calspair units

2005-04-10  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chunk-common.xsl: Fix link to ToC when chunk.toc.and.lots is 1.

2005-04-04  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* html.xsl: Support xml:id in anchor

	* inline.xsl: Support termdef

	* math.xsl: Support mathphrase

2005-03-09  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* component.xsl: Fixed colophon/subtitle per bug #1156450

	* footnote.xsl: Fixed bug 1156645: footnote para doesn't propagate role.

2005-03-08  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* block.xsl, titlepage.xsl: Fixed bug 1123291: more than one authorinitials in revhistory.

2005-03-02  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graphics.xsl: Pass $img.src.path to Java image extensions when appropriate

	* graphics.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: Passing of $img.src.path to Java image extensions is conditional and it is controlled by newly added graphicsize.use.img.src.path parameter.

2005-02-17  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* admon.xsl: Removed unneeded colspan from graphical admon table cell.

2004-11-23  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autotoc.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: RFE #1069397 Add new parameter simplesect.in.toc
	
	  - default value of 0 causes simplesect to be omitted from TOCs
	  - to cause simplesect to be included in TOCs, you must set the
	    value of simplesect.in.toc to 1
	
	note from Norm:
	
	  Simplesect elements aren't supposed to appear in the ToC at
	  all. Ugh. The Definitive Guide doesn't really explain that
	  very well.
	
	  The use case for simplesect is when, for example, every
	  chapter in a book ends with "Exercises" or "For More
	  Information" sections and you don't want those to appear in
	  the ToC.

	* refentry.xsl: Patch #1057029 - Fix titleabbrev warnings in reference (patch from
	anatoly techtonik)

	* sections.xsl: Bug #1068455 (Invalid h7, h8, etc. generated for deeply nested sections)
	
	::CAUSE
	  Stylesheet HTML heading-generation didn't anticipate that some
	  jokers like to nest sections really, really deep. Not naming any
	  names...
	
	::FIX
	  Refined logic to safely handle documents produced by the "I can
	  nest sections deeper than you can" crowd

2004-11-19  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sections.xsl: Bug #1066753 -- subtitle is severely broken (reported by Sam Steingold)
	
	::PROBLEM
	  In (X)HTML output, subtitle for the simplesect element generates an
	  h2 head, no matter at what level in the sectioning hiearchy the
	  simplesect occurs; end up with cases where a simplesect is
	  output with (for example), an h4 title but a h2 subtitle
	
	::CAUSE and FIX
	  No template for simplesect/subtitle in the set of templates that
	  call the section.subtitle named template, so stylesheets fell
	  back to using the titlepage.mode template for subtitle
	
	::FIX
	  Added simplesect/subtitle to the set of templates that
	  call the section.subtitle named template.
	
	::AFFECTS
	  Only affects (X)HTML output of simplesect/subtitle; nothing else

2004-11-17  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.param, autoidx.xsl, docbook.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: 
	Added new parameter index.prefer.titleabbrev. When set to 1, index references will use titleabbrev instead of title when available.

2004-11-13  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* inline.xsl: Replace <tt></tt> output with <code></code>

	* verbatim.xsl: Deprecated shade.verbatim

2004-10-25  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autotoc.xsl: Request #585543 (Quickref-style reference ToC)
	
	Wrapped ToC refentrytitle/refname and refpurpose in
	span with class values. This makes it possible to style
	them using a CSS stylesheet containing something like below.
	
	Implementing tablular look for FO output will have to wait...
	
	div.toc {
	  padding-bottom: 20px;
	}
	
	div.toc dt, div.toc li {
	  clear: both;
	}
	
	div.toc span.refentrytitle {
	  float: left;
	  text-align: left;
	}
	
	div.toc span.refpurpose {
	  float: right;
	  width: 65%;
	  text-align: left;
	}
	
	hr {
	  clear: both;
	}

	* synop.xsl: Feature Request #1008804 (command in cmdsynopsis is not indented)
	
	Added some CSS magic to enable the requested effect; this change:
	
	  - makes all cmdsynopses monospaced
	
	  - creates CSS floats that make a hanging indent (aka tabular
	    presentation) for cmdysnopsis; command name appears first
	    column, everything else (arg/group/synopfragment) goes to
	    second column
	
	Probably should also add parameters to toggle behavior on/off...

2004-10-24  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glossary.xsl: Fixed bug #1031851. Target of link is computed by href.target template.

2004-10-14  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chunk-code.xsl, chunk-common.xsl, manifest.xsl: Bug #1046371 - chunk children of Part
	
	Problem:
	  Glossary, Bibliography, and Index were not getting chunked when
	  they occurred as children of Part. They should be, because other
	  components (Chapter, Article, Appendix, etc.) within Part are
	  chunked.
	
	Fix:
	  Added code to have Part chunked in same manner as Book and
	  Article.
	
	Areas affected:
	  Chunking (no effect on non-chunked output) + manifest
	
	Notes:
	  Discovered a different bug when testing this (bug #1047151):
	  content of indexes within components sometimes end up being
	  identical to content of the master index for the whole division
	  they are a part of (e.g., the whole Book or Set)

	* titlepage.xsl: DocBook 4.2 allows e-mail address inside author element and now is this feature supported also by stylesheets. Not sure whether this solution is the best, but it works.

2001-07-17  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xref.xsl: xref element with endterm attribute now uses normal templates

	* component.xsl: Fix bug in processing of subtitle content on components
