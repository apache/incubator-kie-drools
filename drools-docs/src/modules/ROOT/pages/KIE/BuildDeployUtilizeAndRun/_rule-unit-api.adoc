= Rule Unit API

Previous sections in this chapter explained traditional KIE APIs to use {RULE_ENGINE}. However, as introduced in xref:getting-started/index.adoc#first-rule-project_getting-started[First Rule Project], Rule Unit is a new and recommended style for implementing rules since {PRODUCT} 8.

A rule unit is an atomic module defining a set of rules and a set of strongly typed *data sources* through which the facts processed by the rules are inserted. The *data sources* of 2 kinds: `DataStream` and `DataStore` which will be described later in this section.

`DataSources` can be shared across different units, providing a coordination mechanism between them.

== RuleUnitData

`RuleUnitData` is an interface to define your Rule Unit. Rule unit implementation would be like this:

[source,java]
----
public class MeasurementUnit implements RuleUnitData {

    private final DataStore<Measurement> measurements;
    private final Set<String> controlSet = new HashSet<>();

    public MeasurementUnit() {
        this(DataSource.createStore());
    }

    public MeasurementUnit(DataStore<Measurement> measurements) {
        this.measurements = measurements;
    }

    public DataStore<Measurement> getMeasurements() {
        return measurements;
    }

    public Set<String> getControlSet() {
        return controlSet;
    }
}
----

In this case, `Measurement` is your fact class, so you need to implement it as well.

The name of the rule unit class `MeasurementUnit` is linked to DRL rules using the `unit` statement.

[source]
----
package org.example;
unit MeasurementUnit;

rule "will execute per each Measurement having ID color"
when
  ....
----

== Data sources

Data sources are typed sources of data that rule units can subscribe to for updates. You interact with the rule unit through the data sources it exposes.

{PRODUCT} supports the following types of data sources.

* `DataStream`: An append-only storage option. Use this storage option when you want to publish or share data values. You can use the notation `DataSource.createStream()` to return a `DataStream<T>` object and use the method `append(T)` to add more data.
+
.Example DataStream data source usage
[source,java]
----
DataStream<Measurement> measurements = DataSource.createStream();
// Append value and notify all subscribers
measurements.append(new Measurement("color", "red"));
----

* `DataStore`: A writable storage option for adding or removing data and then notifying all subscribers that mutable data has been modified. Rules can pattern-match against incoming values and update or remove available values.
For users familiar with traditional DRL syntax, this option is equivalent to a typed version of an entry point. In fact, a `DataStore<Object>` is equivalent to a traditional-style entry point.
+
.Example DataStore data source usage
[source,java]
----
DataStore<Measurement> measurements = DataSource.createStore();
Measurement measurement = new Measurement("color", "red");
// Add value and notify all subscribers
DataHandle mHandle = measurements.add(measurement);
measure.setValue("blue");
// Notify all subscribers that the value referenced by `mHandle` has changed
measurements.update(mHandle, measurement);
// Remove value referenced by `mHandle` and notify all subscribers
measurements.remove(mHandle);
----

* `SingletonStore`: A writable storage option for setting or clearing a single element and then notifying all subscribers that the element has been modified. Rules can pattern-match against the value and update or clear available values.
For users familiar with traditional DRL syntax, this option is similar to a global but reactive to changes. A `Singleton<Object>` is similar to a traditional-style global, except that when used in conjunction with rules, you can pattern-match against it.
+
.Example SingletonStore data source definition
[source,java]
----
SingletonStore<Measurement> measurement = DataSource.createSingleton();
Measurement m1 = new Measurement("color", "red");
// Add value `m1` and notify all subscribers
measurement.set(m1);
measure.setValue("blue");
// Notify all subscribers that the value has changed
measurement.update();

Measurement m2 = new Measurement("color", "green");
// Overwrite contained value with `m2` and notify all subscribers
measurement.set(m2);
measure2.setValue("black");
// Notify all subscribers that the value has changed
measurement.update();

// Clear store and notify all subscribers
measurement.clear();
----

Subscribers to a data source are known as _data processors_. A data processor implements the `DataProcessor<T>` interface. This interface contains callbacks to all the events that a subscribed data source can trigger.

.DataProcessor
[source,java]
----
public interface DataProcessor<T> {
    default void insert(T object) {
        insert(null, object);
    }
    FactHandle insert(DataHandle handle, T object);
    void update(DataHandle handle, T object);
    void delete(DataHandle handle);
}
----

The `DataHandle` is an internal reference to an object of a data source. Each callback method might or might not be invoked, depending on whether the corresponding data source implements the capability. For example, a `DataStream` source invokes only the `insert` callback, whereas a `SingletonStore` source invokes the `insert` callback on `set` and the `delete` callback on `clear` or before an overwriting `set`.

Note that `DataProcessor` is a little internal detail. If you instantiate `RuleUnitInstance`, `EntryPointDataProcessor` is automatically bound to the rule unit's data sources.

== Client code

Finally, you instantiate a `RuleUnitInstance` using `RuleUnitProvider` to execute the rules.

[source,java]
----
    public void test() {
        MeasurementUnit measurementUnit = new MeasurementUnit();

        try (RuleUnitInstance<MeasurementUnit> instance = RuleUnitProvider.get().createRuleUnitInstance(measurementUnit)) {
            measurementUnit.getMeasurements().add(new Measurement("color", "red"));
            ...

            List<Measurement> queryResult = instance.executeQuery("FindColor").stream().map(tuple -> (Measurement) tuple.get("$m")).collect(toList());
            ...
        } // instance.close() is called automatically
    }
----

=== Configurations

You can add configurations by creating `RuleUnitInstance` with `RuleConfig`.

.Configuring event listeners
[source,java]
----
        RuleConfig ruleConfig = RuleUnitProvider.get().newRuleConfig();
        ruleConfig.getAgendaEventListeners().add(new MyAgendaEventListener());
        ruleConfig.getRuleRuntimeListeners().add(new MyRuleRuntimeEventListener());
        ruleConfig.getRuleEventListeners().add(new MyRuleEventListener());

        HelloWorldUnit unit = new HelloWorldUnit();
        RuleUnitInstance<HelloWorldUnit> unitInstance = RuleUnitProvider.get().createRuleUnitInstance(unit, ruleConfig);
----

== Declare rule units in DRL

Instead of writing a Java class, you can declare rule units directly in DRL. See xref:language-reference/index.adoc#con-drl-rule-units_drl-rules[Rule units in DRL].
