= DMN support in {PRODUCT}

{DMN_ENGINE} provides runtime support for DMN 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 models at conformance level 3.

{DMN_EDITOR} provides design support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3.

You can integrate DMN models with your {PRODUCT} decision services in several ways:

* Design your DMN models using the {DMN_EDITOR} online.
* Design your DMN models using the {DMN_EDITOR} in VSCode.
* Import DMN files into your project by opening them in {DMN_EDITOR}. Any DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models (do not contain DMN 1.3 features) that you import or open into {DMN_EDITOR} and save are converted to DMN 1.2 models.
* Package DMN files as part of your project knowledge JAR (KJAR) file without {DMN_EDITOR}.

The following table summarizes the design and runtime support for each DMN version in {PRODUCT}:

In addition to all DMN conformance level 3 requirements, {DMN_ENGINE} also includes enhancements and fixes to FEEL and DMN model components to optimize the experience of implementing DMN decision services with {PRODUCT}. From a platform perspective, DMN models are like any other business asset in {PRODUCT}, such as DRL files or spreadsheet decision tables, that you can include in your {PRODUCT} project and deploy in order to start your DMN decision services.

For more information about including external DMN files with your {PRODUCT} project packaging and deployment method, see
the xref:KIE/index.adoc[Build, Deploy, Utilize and Run section].

You can design a new DMN decision service using a {KOGITO} microservice as an alternative for the cloud-native capabilities of DMN decision services. You could also migrate your existing DMN service to a {KOGITO} microservice. For more information about {KOGITO} or migrating to {KOGITO} microservices, see the https://kogito.kie.org/guides/[Kogito website for documentation].
