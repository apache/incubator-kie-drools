= Packages in DRL

A package is a folder of related assets in {PRODUCT}, such as data objects, DRL files, decision tables, and other asset types. A package also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple packages. You typically store all the rules for a package in the same file as the package declaration so that the package is self-contained. However, you can import objects from other packages that you want to use in the rules.

The following example is a package name and namespace for a DRL file in a mortgage application decision service:

.Example package definition in a DRL file

----
package org.mortgages;

ifdef::DROOLS,JBPM,OP[]

Note that a package _must_ have a namespace and be declared using standard Java conventions for package names; i.e., no spaces, unlike rule names which allow spaces.
In terms of the order of elements, they can appear in any order in the rule file, with the exception of the `package` statement, which must be at the top of the file.
In all cases, the semicolons are optional.

Notice that any rule attribute (as described the section Rule Attributes) may also be written at package level, superseding the attribute's default value.
The modified default may still be replaced by an attribute setting within a rule.
