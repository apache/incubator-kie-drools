  <title>Event Metadata</title>

  <para>All events have a set of metadata associated to them. Most of the
  metadata values have defaults that are automatically assigned to each event
  when they are inserted into the working memory, but it is possible to change
  the default on an event type basis, using the metadata tags listed
  bellow.</para>

  <para>For the examples, lets assume the user has the following class in the
  application domain model:</para>

  <example>
    <title>the VoiceCall fact class</title>

    <programlisting role="JAVA">/**
 * A class that represents a voice call in 
 * a Telecom domain model
 */
public class VoiceCall {
    private String  originNumber;
    private String  destinationNumber;
    private Date    callDateTime;
    private long    callDuration;          // in milliseconds

    // constructors, getters and setters
}
</programlisting>
  </example>

  <section>
    <title>@role</title>

    <para>The @role meta data was already discussed in the previous section
    and is presented here for completeness:</para>

    <programlisting><emphasis>@role</emphasis>( &lt;fact|event&gt; )
</programlisting>

    <para>It annotates a given fact type as either a regular fact or event. It
    accepts either "fact" or "event" as a parameter. Default is "fact".</para>

    <example>
      <title>declaring VoiceCall as an event type</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para></para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>@timestamp</title>

    <para>Every event has an associated timestamp assigned to it. By default,
    the timestamp for a given event is read from the Session Clock and
    assigned to the event at the time the event is inserted into the working
    memory. Although, sometimes, the event has the timestamp as one of it's
    own attributes. In this case, the user may tell the engine to use the
    timestamp from the event's attribute instead of reading it from the
    Session Clock.</para>

    <programlisting><emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( &lt;attributeName&gt; )</programlisting>

    <para>To tell the engine what attribute to use as the source of the
    event's timestamp, just list the attribute name as a parameter to the
    @timestamp tag.</para>

    <example>
      <title>declaring the VoiceCall timestamp attribute</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
    <emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( callDateTime )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
</programlisting>
    </example>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>@duration</title>

    <para>Drools supports both event semantics: point-in-time events and
    interval-based events. A point-in-time event is represented as an
    interval-based event whose duration is zero. By default, all events have
    duration zero. The user may attribute a different duration for an event by
    declaring which attribute in the event type contains the duration of the
    event.</para>

    <programlisting><emphasis>@duration</emphasis>( &lt;attributeName&gt; )</programlisting>

    <para>So, for our VoiceCall fact type, the declaration would be:</para>

    <example>
      <title>declaring the VoiceCall duration attribute</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
    <emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( callDateTime )
    <emphasis>@duration</emphasis>( callDuration )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
    </example>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>@expires</title>

    <important>
      <para>This tag is only considered when running the engine in STREAM
      mode. Also, additional discussion on the effects of using this tag is
      made on the Memory Management section. It is included here for
      completeness.</para>
    </important>

    <para>Events may be automatically expired after some time in the working
    memory. Typically this happens when, based on the existing rules in the
    knowledge base, the event can no longer match and activate any rules.
    Although, it is possible to explicitly define when an event should
    expire.</para>

    <programlisting><emphasis>@expires</emphasis>( &lt;timeOffset&gt; )</programlisting>

    <para>The value of <emphasis>timeOffset</emphasis> is a temporal interval
    in the form:</para>

    <programlisting>[#d][#h][#m][#s][#[ms]]</programlisting>

    <para>Where <emphasis>[ ]</emphasis> means an optional parameter and
    <emphasis>#</emphasis> means a numeric value.</para>

    <para>So, to declare that the VoiceCall facts should be expired after 1
    hour and 35 minutes after they are inserted into the working memory, the
    user would write:</para>

    <para><example>
        <title>declaring the expiration offset for the VoiceCall
        events</title>

        <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">declare</emphasis> VoiceCall
    <emphasis>@role</emphasis>( event )
    <emphasis>@timestamp</emphasis>( callDateTime )
    <emphasis>@duration</emphasis>( callDuration )
    <emphasis>@expires</emphasis>( 1h35m )
<emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></programlisting>
      </example></para>

    <para></para>
