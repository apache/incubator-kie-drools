= Example decision management architectures with {PRODUCT}

The following scenarios illustrate common variations of {PRODUCT} installation, asset authoring, project storage, project deployment, and asset execution in a decision management architecture. Each section summarizes the methods and tools used and the advantages for the given architecture. The examples are basic and are only a few of the many combinations you might consider, depending on your specific goals and needs with {PRODUCT}.

ifdef::DM,PAM[]
{PRODUCT} environments on OpenShift with {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER}::
+
--
* *Installation environment*: {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, using the operator to deploy an `{PRODUCT_INIT}-authoring` environment and other types of environment as necessary.
* *Project storage and build environment*: External Git repository for project versioning synchronized with the {CENTRAL} Git repository using Git hooks, and external Maven repository for project management and building configured with {KIE_SERVER}
* *Asset-authoring tool*: {CENTRAL}
* *Main asset types*: Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models for decisions
ifdef::PAM[and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models for processes]
* *Project deployment and execution environment*: {KIE_SERVER} on {OPENSHIFT}
* *Scenario advantages*:
** Containerized implementation of {PRODUCT} in a cloud-based development environment. Components of {PRODUCT} are deployed as separate OpenShift pods that you can scale up and down individually, providing as few or as many containers as necessary for a particular component. You can use standard OpenShift methods to manage the pods and balance the load.
** Access to the repositories, assets, asset designers, and project build options in {CENTRAL}.
** Standardized asset-authoring approach using DMN
ifdef::PAM,JBPM[and BPMN]
for optimal integration and stability.
** Access to {KIE_SERVER} functionality and KIE APIs for asset deployment and execution.

* *Scenario advantages*:
** Flexible implementation of {PRODUCT} in an on-premise development environment
** Ability to define business assets using an external IDE and other asset-authoring tools of your choice
** Access to {KIE_SERVER} functionality and KIE APIs for asset deployment and execution

* *Installation environment*: {PRODUCT} libraries embedded within a custom application

* *Project deployment and execution environment*: Embedded Java application, such as in a Java virtual machine (JVM) environment, microservice, or custom application server
* *Scenario advantages*:
** Custom implementation of {PRODUCT} in an on-premise development environment with an embedded Java application
** Ability to define business assets using an external IDE and other asset-authoring tools of your choice
** Use of custom APIs to interact with core KIE APIs (not {KIE_SERVER} APIs) and to execute assets in the embedded engine
