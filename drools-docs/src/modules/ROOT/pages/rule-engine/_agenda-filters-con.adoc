The {RULE_ENGINE} supports an `AgendaFilter` object in the filter interface that you can use to allow or deny the evaluation of specified rules during agenda evaluation. You can specify an agenda filter as part of a `fireAllRules()` call.

The following example code permits only rules ending with the string `"Test"` to be evaluated and executed. All other rules are filtered out of the {RULE_ENGINE} agenda.

.Example agenda filter definition
[source,java]
----
ksession.fireAllRules( new RuleNameEndsWithAgendaFilter( "Test" ) );
