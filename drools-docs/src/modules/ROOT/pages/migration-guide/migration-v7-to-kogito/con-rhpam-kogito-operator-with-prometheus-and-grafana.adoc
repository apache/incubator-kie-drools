= Red Hat Process Automation Manager Kogito Operator interaction with Prometheus and Grafana

{KOGITO} in {PRODUCT} provides a `monitoring-prometheus-addon` add-on that enables Prometheus metrics monitoring for {KOGITO} microservices and generates Grafana dashboards that consume the default metrics exported by the add-on. The RHPAM Kogito Operator uses the  https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator[Prometheus Operator] to expose the metrics from your project for Prometheus to scrape. Due to this dependency, the Prometheus Operator must be installed in the same namespace as your project.

If you want to enable the Prometheus metrics monitoring for your {KOGITO} microservices, add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file in your project, depending on the framework you are using:

.Dependency for Prometheus {QUARKUS} add-on
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
      <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
      <artifactId>monitoring-prometheus-quarkus-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.Dependency for Prometheus Spring Boot add-on
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
      <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
      <artifactId>monitoring-prometheus-springboot-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

When you deploy a {KOGITO} microservice that uses the `monitoring-prometheus-addon` add-on and the Prometheus Operator is installed, the Red Hat Process Automation Manager Kogito Operator creates a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource to expose the metrics for Prometheus, as shown in the following example:

.Example `ServiceMonitor` resource for Prometheus
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app: onboarding-service
  name: onboarding-service
  namespace: kogito
spec:
  endpoints:
  - path: /metrics
    targetPort: 8080
    scheme: http
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
    - kogito
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: onboarding-service
----

You must manually configure your `Prometheus` custom resource that is managed by the Prometheus Operator to select the `ServiceMonitor` resource:

.Example `Prometheus` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  serviceAccountName: prometheus
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dmn-drools-quarkus-metrics-service
----

After you configure your Prometheus resource with the `ServiceMonitor` resource, you can see the endpoint scraped by Prometheus in the *Targets* page in the Prometheus web console. The metrics exposed by the {PRODUCT} service appear in the *Graph* view.

The RHPAM Kogito Operator also creates a `GrafanaDashboard` custom resource defined by the https://operatorhub.io/operator/grafana-operator[Grafana Operator] for each of the Grafana dashboards generated by the add-on. The `app` label for the dashboards is the name of the deployed {KOGITO} microservice. You must set the `dashboardLabelSelector` property of the `Grafana` custom resource according to the relevant {KOGITO} microservice.

.Example `Grafana` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: integreatly.org/v1alpha1
kind: Grafana
metadata:
  name: example-grafana
spec:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
  config:
    auth:
      disable_signout_menu: true
    auth.anonymous:
      enabled: true
    log:
      level: warn
      mode: console
    security:
      admin_password: secret
      admin_user: root
  dashboardLabelSelector:
    - matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
            - my-kogito-application
