= Example of binding an external application to a {KOGITO} deployment

After deploying the {KOGITO} microservice, you need to bind your external application to the {KOGITO} microservice deployment.

Binding your external application includes re-routing the external application and binding the application to a new base URL of the server that is associated with the {KOGITO} application. For more information, see the following example:
