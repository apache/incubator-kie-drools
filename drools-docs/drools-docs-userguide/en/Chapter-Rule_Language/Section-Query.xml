  <para>A query contains the structure of the LHS of a rule only (you don't
  specify "when" or "then"). It is simply a way to query the working memory
  for facts that match the conditions stated. A query has an optional set of
  parameters, that can also be optionally typed, if type is not given then
  Object type is assumed and the engine will attempt to co-erce the values as
  needed.</para>

  <para>To return the results use WorkingMemory.getQueryResults("name") -
  where "name" is query name. Query names are global to the RuleBase, so do
  not add queries of the same name to different packages for the same Rule
  Base. This contains a list of query results, which allow you to to get to
  the objects that matched the query.</para>

  <para>This example creates a simple query for all the people over the age of
  30</para>

  <example>
    <title>Query People over the age of 30</title>

    <programlisting>query "people over the age of 30" 
    person : Person( age &gt; 30 )
end</programlisting>
  </example>

  <example>
    <title>Query People over the age of X, and who live in y</title>

    <programlisting>query "people over the age of X"  (int x, String y)
    person : Person( age &gt; x, location == y )
end</programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>We iterate over the returned QueryResults using a standard 'for' loop.
  Each row returns a QueryResult which we can use to access each of the
  columns in the Tuple. Those columns can be access by bound declaration name
  or index position.</para>

  <example>
    <title>Query People over the age of 30</title>

    <programlisting>QueryResults results = workingMemory.getQueryResults( "people over the age of 30" );
System.out.println( "we have " + results.size() + " people over the age  of 30" );

System.out.println( "These people are are over 30:" );

for ( Iterator it = results.iterator; it.hasNext(); ) {
    QueryResult result = ( QueryResult ) it.next();
    Person person = ( Person ) result.get( "person" );
    System.out.println( person.getName() + "\n" );
}</programlisting>
  </example>
