= Defining DMN decision logic in boxed expressions in {CENTRAL}

Boxed expressions in DMN are tables that you use to define the underlying logic of decision nodes and business knowledge models in a decision requirements diagram (DRD) or decision requirements graph (DRG). Some boxed expressions can contain other boxed expressions, but the top-level boxed expression corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRD artifact. While DRDs with one or more DRGs represent the flow of a DMN decision model, boxed expressions define the actual decision logic of individual nodes. DRDs and boxed expressions together form a complete and functional DMN decision model.

You can use the DMN designer in {CENTRAL} to define decision logic for your DRD components using built-in boxed expressions.

.Prerequisites
* You have created or imported a DMN file in {CENTRAL}.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*, click the project name, and select the DMN file you want to modify.
. In the DMN designer canvas, select a decision node or business knowledge model that you want to define and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression designer:

By default, all business knowledge models are defined as boxed function expressions containing a literal FEEL expression, a nested context expression of an external JAVA or PMML function, or a nested boxed expression of any type.

For decision nodes, you double-click the undefined table to select the type of boxed expression you want to use, such as a boxed literal expression, boxed context expression, decision table, or other DMN boxed expression.

For business knowledge models, you right-click the value cell and select the type of expression you want to use, or click *Clear* and double-click the cleared cell to select a boxed expression of another type.

. For this example, use a decision node and select *Decision table* as the boxed expression type.

A decision table in DMN is a visual representation of one or more rules in a tabular format. Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions (input) and outcome (output) for that particular row.
. Double-click the input column header to define the name and data type for the input condition. For example, name the input column *Credit Score.FICO* with a `number` data type. This column specifies numeric credit score values or ranges of loan applicants.
. Double-click the output column header to define the name and data type for the output values. For example, name the output column *Credit Score Rating* and next to the *Data Type* option, click *Manage* to create a custom data type with score ratings as constraints.

. In the *Manage Custom Data Types* window, click *Add* and create a *Credit_Score_Rating* data type as a `string` with the following constraints: `"Excellent","Good","Fair","Poor","Bad"`.
+

. Click *Save* to save the data type, and in the decision table, double-click the *Credit Score Rating* column header and set the data type to this new custom data type.
. Use the *Credit Score.FICO* input column to define credit score values or ranges of values, and use the *Credit Score Rating* column to specify one of the corresponding ratings you defined in the *Credit_Score_Rating* data type.
+
Right-click any value cell to insert or delete rows (rules) or columns (clauses).

. After you define all rules, click the top-left corner of the decision table to define the rule *Hit Policy* and *Builtin Aggregator* (for *COLLECT* hit policy only).
+
--
The hit policy determines how to reach an outcome when multiple rules in a decision table match the provided input values. The built-in aggregator determines how to aggregate rule values when you use the *COLLECT* hit policy.

NOTE: The *Orientation* option is not supported in the {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION} DMN designer and will be removed from the {CENTRAL} user interface in a future release. This option determines whether rows, columns, or both rows and columns (*CrossTable*) represent rules in DMN decision tables.

The following is a more complex decision table that determines applicant qualification for a loan as the concluding decision node in the same loan prequalification decision model:

For boxed expression types other than decision tables, you follow these guidelines similarly to navigate the boxed expression tables and define variables and parameters for decision logic, but according to the requirements of the boxed expression type. Some boxed expressions, such as boxed literal expressions, can be single-column tables, while other boxed expressions, such as function, context, and invocation expressions, can be multi-column tables with nested boxed expressions of other types.

For example, the following boxed context expression defines the parameters that determine whether a loan applicant can meet minimum mortgage payments based on principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI), represented as a front-end ratio calculation with a sub-context expression:

.Boxed context expression for front-end client PITI ratio

The following boxed function expression determines a monthly mortgage installment as a business knowledge model in a lending decision, with the function value defined as a nested context expression:
