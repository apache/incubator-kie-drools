= Hit policies in DMN decision tables

Hit policies determine how to reach an outcome when multiple rules in a decision table match the provided input values. For example, if one rule in a decision table applies a sales discount to military personnel and another rule applies a discount to students, then when a customer is both a student and in the military, the decision table hit policy must indicate whether to apply one discount or the other (*Unique*, *First*) or both discounts (*Collect Sum*). You specify the single character of the hit policy (*U*, *F*, *C+*) in the upper-left corner of the decision table.

The following are supported DMN decision table hit policies:

* *Unique (U):* Permits only one rule to match. Any overlap raises an error.
* *Any (A):* Permits multiple rules to match, but they must all have the same output. If multiple matching rules do not have the same output, an error is raised.
* *Priority (P):* Permits multiple rules to match, with different outputs. The output that comes first in the output values list is selected.
* *First (F):* Uses the first match in rule order.
* *Collect (C+, C>, C<, C#):* Aggregates output from multiple rules based on an aggregation function.
** *Collect ( C ):* Aggregates values in an arbitrary list.
** *Collect Sum (C+):* Outputs the sum of all collected values. Values must be numeric.
** *Collect Min (C<):* Outputs the minimum value among the matches. The resulting values must be comparable, such as numbers, dates, or text (lexicographic order).
** *Collect Max (C>):* Outputs the maximum value among the matches. The resulting values must be comparable, such as numbers, dates or text (lexicographic order).
** *Collect Count (C#):* Outputs the number of matching rules.
