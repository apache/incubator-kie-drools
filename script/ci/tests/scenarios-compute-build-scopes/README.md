# CiComputeBuildScopes snapshot scenarios

Each subdirectory is a scenario for
[`CiComputeBuildScopesTest.java`](../CiComputeBuildScopesTest.java): the runner
feeds `changed-files.txt` to `CiComputeBuildScopes` and asserts the produced
`changed` / `affected` / `upstream` lists match the committed `expected-*.txt`
goldens.

Scenarios are numbered (`01-`, `02-`, …) so new ones append without
renumbering. What each one exercises is explained in its own `README.md`.

## Module add / remove

There is no dedicated "adds a module" or "removes a module" scenario:

- **Add.** The new module's files are on disk at checkout, so they map like any
  other module. The operation that actually defines the addition — editing the
  parent `<module>` list — is covered by `06-aggregator-pom`.
- **Remove.** The module is absent from both disk and the reactor graph, so
  paths under it walk up to the nearest surviving ancestor — covered by
  `07-removed-module`.

## Updating the goldens

`CiComputeBuildScopes` builds the extension on demand, so this is a one-liner:

```bash
CI_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 jbang script/ci/tests/CiComputeBuildScopesTest.java
git add script/ci/tests/scenarios-compute-build-scopes/*/expected-*.txt
```

When CI fails because the cascade shifted (module moved, dep added/dropped,
module added/removed from the reactor), regenerate and commit the updated
goldens in a **separate, dedicated PR** so reviewers can judge whether the
shift is expected.

## Adding a scenario

1. `mkdir script/ci/tests/scenarios-compute-build-scopes/NN-short-name/`
2. Write `changed-files.txt` — real repo-relative paths, or non-existent paths
   to simulate deletions.
3. Write a short `README.md` explaining the case.
4. Run `CI_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 jbang script/ci/tests/CiComputeBuildScopesTest.java`
   to generate the `expected-*.txt` files.
5. Commit everything.
