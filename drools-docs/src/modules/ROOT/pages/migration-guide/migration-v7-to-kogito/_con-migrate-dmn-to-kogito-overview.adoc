= Migration of a DMN service from {PRODUCT} v7 to a {KOGITO} microservice

[role="_abstract"]
You can migrate DMN-based decision services from {PRODUCT} v7 to {KOGITO} microservices by moving the DMN resources from KJAR artifacts to the respective {KOGITO} project. In the {KOGITO} microservices, some of the KIE v7 features are no longer required.

== Major changes and migration considerations

The following table describes the major changes and features that affect migration from the {KIE_SERVER} API and KJAR to {KOGITO} deployments:

.DMN migration considerations
[cols="30%,35%,35%" options="header"]
|===
|Feature
|In {KIE_SERVER} API
|In {KOGITO} artifact

|DMN models
|stored in `src/main/resources` of KJAR.
|copy as is to `src/main/resources`.

|Object models (POJOs) required for {KIE_SERVER} generic marshalling
|managed using Data Model object editor in {BUSINESS_CENTRAL}.
|object model editing is no longer required.

|`DMNRuntimeListener`
|configured using a system property or `kmodule.xml` file.
|must be configured using CDI, by annotating the `DMNRuntimeEventListener` with CDIâ€™s `@ApplicationScope` annotation.

|Other configuration options
|configured using system property or `kmodule.xml` file.
|except `DMNRuntimeEventListener`, only default values are considered and no override of configuration is supported.

|{KIE_SERVER} Client API
|used in conjunction with object models to interact with a KJAR that is deployed on the {KIE_SERVER}.
a|for object models, this feature is no longer required.

NOTE: You can select your own choice of REST library.

|REST API
|when a KJAR is deployed on {KIE_SERVER}, the applications interacting with specific DMN model endpoint, use the same API on {KOGITO} deployment.
|advanced support for specific DMN model generation.

|Test scenarios
|run with a JUnit activator.
|analogous JUnit activator is available on {KOGITO}.

|===

NOTE: The features that are not mentioned in the previous table are either not supported or not required in a cloud-native {KOGITO} deployment.

== Migration strategy

[role="_abstract"]
When migrating a DMN project to a {KOGITO} project, first you can migrate external applications that are interacting with decision services on the {KIE_SERVER}. You can use the REST endpoints that are specific to DMN models. After using the REST endpoints, you can migrate the external applications from the {KIE_SERVER} to a {KOGITO} deployment. For additional information about specific REST endpoints to DMN models, you can reference the https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/new-model-specific-dmn-kie-server-endpoints.html[_REST endpoints for specific DMN models_ blog post].

The migration strategy includes the following steps:

. Migrate existing external applications from the generic {KIE_SERVER} API to a specific DMN REST endpoint using the {KIE_SERVER}.
. Migrate a KJAR that is deployed on the {KIE_SERVER} to a {KOGITO} microservice.
. Deploy the {KOGITO} microservice using {OPENSHIFT}.
. Reconnect the external application and migrate the REST API consumption from the specific DMN REST endpoint to the {KOGITO} deployment.
