    <title>Quick start guide</title>

    <para>If you are reading this, you must be the impatient type who wants to
    kick the tyres (and light the fires) and have a look around as soon as
    possible. This section will provide a quick end to end tour of the steps
    involved (but does not go through the concepts in detail). This assumes
    you have installed the repository correctly, and are able to access the
    main login screen.</para>

    <para>You can also consult the wiki:
    http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=RulesRepository for some
    tutorials and user tips (it IS a wiki, so you can even contribute your own
    tips and examples and even upload files if you desire !).</para>

      <title>Supported browser platforms</title>

      <para>The supported server side platforms are mentioned in the
      installation guide. For browsers - the major ones are supported, this
      includes Firefox (1.5 and up), IE7 and up, Opera, Safari, Google Chrome
      etc. The preferred browser for most platforms is firefox, it is widely
      available and free, if you have any choice at all, Firefox is the
      preferred platform, followed by safari on mac. IE6 users can experience
      some poor perforamnce, and as this is a dangerously insecure browser IE7
      or a superior browser (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari) is
      recommended.</para>

      <title>Initial configuration</title>

      <para>Some initial setup is required the first time. The first time the
      server starts up, it will create an empty repository, then take the
      following steps:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Once deployed, go to "http://&lt;your
          server&gt;/drools-jbrms/" (This will show the initial info screen -
          or login screen depending on the configuration).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If it is a brand new repository, you will want to go to
          "Admin", and choose "Manage Categories"</para>

          <para>(Add a few categories of your choosing, categories are only
          for classification, not for execution or anything else.)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Rules need a fact model (object model) to work off, so next
          you will want to go to the Package management feature. From here you
          can click on the icon to create a new package (give it a meaningful
          name, with no spaces).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>To upload a model, use a jar which has the fact model (API)
          that you will be using in your rules and your code (go and make one
          now if you need to !). When you are in the model editor screen, you
          can upload a jar file, choose the package name from the list that
          you created in the previous step.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Now edit your package configuration (you just created) to

        <listitem>
          <para>At this point, the package is configured and ready to go (you
          generally won't have to go through that step very often).</para>

          <para>(Note that you can also import an existing drl package - it
          will store the rules in the repository as individual assets).</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>You will also have to choose one category. Categories provide
          a way of viewing rules that is separate to packages (and you can

          <para>You can also add/remove categories from the rule editor, and
          other attributes such as documentation (if you aren't sure what to

      <title>Finding stuff</title>

      <para>In terms of navigating, you can either use the Rules feature,
      which shows things grouped by categories, or you can use the Package
      feature, and view by package (and rule type). If you know the name or
      part of the name of an asset, you can also use the "Quick find", start
      typing a rule name and it will return a list of matches as you type (so
      if you have a sensible naming scheme, it will make it very quick to find
      stuff).</para>

          This freezes the package at that point in time, so any concurrent

    <title>BRMS concepts</title>

    <section>
      <title>Rules are assets</title>

      <para>As the BRMS can manage many different types of rules (and more),
      they are all classed as "assets". An asset is anything that can be
      stored as a version in the repository. This includes decision tables,
      models, DSLs and more. Sometimes the word "rule" will be used to really
      mean "asset" (ie the things you can do also apply to the other asset
      types). You can think of asset as a lot like a file in a folder. Assets
      are grouped together for viewing, or to make a package for deployment
      etc.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Categorisation</title>

      <figure>
        <title>Categories</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="CatZoom.png" format="PNG"
                       scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Categories allow rules (assets) to be labeled (or tagged) with any
      number of categories that you define. This means that you can then view
      a list of rules that match a specific category. Rules can belong to any
      number of categories. In the above diagram, you can see this can in
      effect create a folder/explorer like view of assets. The names can be
      anything you want, and are defined by the BRMS administrator (you can
      also remove/add new categories - you can only remove them if they are
      not currently in use).</para>

      <para>Generally categories are created with meaningful name that match
      the area of the business the rule applies to (if the rule applies to
      multiple areas, multiple categories can be attached). Categories can
      also be used to "tag" rules as part of their life-cycle, for example to
      mark as "Draft" or "For Review".</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Assets can have multiple categories</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="CatEdit.png" format="PNG"
                       scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The view above shows the category editor/viewer that is seen when
      you open an asset. In this example you can see the asset belongs to 2
      categories, with a "+" button to add additional items (use the trash can
      item to remove them). This means that when either category is used to
      show a list of assets, you will see that asset.</para>

      <para>In the above example, the first Category "Finance" is a "top
      level" category. The second one: "HR/Awards/QAS" is a still a single
      category, but its a nested category: Categories are hierarchical. This
      means there is a category called "HR", which contains a category
      "Awards" (it will in fact have more sub-categories of course), and
      "Awards" has a sub-category of QAS. The screen shows this as
      "HR/Awards/QAS" - its very much like a folder structure you would have
      on your hard disk (the notable exception is of course that rules can
      appear in multiple places).</para>

      <para>When you open an asset to view or edit, it will show a list of
      categories that it currently belongs to If you make a change (remove or
      add a category) you will need to save the asset - this will create a new
      item in the version history. Changing the categories of a rule has no
      effect on its execution.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Creating categories</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="AdminCats.png" format="PNG"
                       scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The above view shows the administration screen for setting up
      categories (there) are no categories in the system by default. As the
      categories can be hierarchical you chose the "parent" category that you
      want to create a sub-category for. From here categories can also be
      removed (but only if they are not in use by any current versions of
      assets).</para>

      <para>As a general rule, an asset should only belong to 1 or 2
      categories at a time. Categories are critical in cases where you have
      large numbers of rules. The hierarchies do not need to be too deep, but
      should be able to see how this can help you break down rules/assets into
      manageable chunks. Its ok if its not clear at first, you are free to
      change categories as you go.</para>

      <para>The above diagram shows the "asset editor" with some annotated

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>B</para>

          <para>This is the documentation area - a free text area where
          descriptions of the rule can live. It is encouraged to write a plain
          description in the rule here before editing.</para>

      <title>Rule authoring</title>

      <para>The BRMS supports a (growing) list of formats of assets (rules).

        <title>Business rules with the guided editor</title>

        <para>Guided editor style "Business rules": (also known as "BRL
        format"). These rules use the guided GUI which controls and prompts
        user input based on knowledge of the object model. This can also be
        augmented with DSL sentences.</para>

        <para>IMPORTANT: to use the BRL guided editor, someone will need to
        have you package configured before hand.</para>

        <para>Also note that there is a guided editor in the Eclipse plug in,
        most of the details in this section can also apply to it.</para>

        </figure>

        <para>The above diagram shows the editor in action. The following
        description apply to the letter boxes in the diagram above:</para>

        <para>A: The different parts of a rule. The "WHEN" part is the
        condition, "THEN" action, and "(options)" are optional attributes that
        may effect the operation of the rule.</para>

        <para>B: This shows a pattern which is declaring that the rule is
        looking for a "Driver" fact (the fields are listed below, in this case
        just "age"). Note the green triangle, it will popup a list of options
        to add to the fact declaration: you can add more fields (eg their
        "location"), or you can assign a variable name to the fact (which you
        can use later on if needs be). As well as adding more fields to this
        pattern - you can add "multiple field" constraints - ie constraints
        that span across fields (eg age &gt; 42 or risk &gt; 2). The popup
        dialog shows the options.</para>

        <para>C: The small "-" icons indicate you can remove something - in
        this case it would remove the whole Driver fact declaration. If its
        the one below, it would remove just the age constraint.</para>

        <para>D: The "+" symbols allow you to add more patterns to the
        condition or the action part of the rule, or more attributes. In all
        cases, a popup option box is provided. For the "WHEN" part of the
        rule, you can choose to add a constraint on a fact (it will give you a
        list of facts), or you can use another conditional element, the
        choices which are : "There is no" - which means the fact+constraints
        must not exist, "There exists" - which means that there exists at
        least one match (but there only needs to be one - it will not trigger
        for each match), and "Any of" - which means that any of the patterns
        can match (you then add patterns to these higher level patterns). If
        you just put a fact (like is shown above) then all the patterns are
        combined together so they are all true ("and").</para>

        <para>E: This shows the constraint for the "age" field. (Looking from
        left to right) the green triangle allows you to "assign" a variable
        name to the "age" field, which you may use later on in the rule. Next
        is the list of constraint operations - this list changes depending on
        the data type. After that is the value field - the value field will be
        one of: a) a literal value (eg number, text), b) a "formula" - in
        which case it is an expression which is calculated (this is for
        advanced users) or b) a variable (in which case a list will be
        provided to choose values from). After this there is a horizontal
        arrow icon, this is for "connective constraints" : these are
        constraints which allow you to have alternative values to check a
        field against, for example: "age is less than 42 or age is not equal
        to 39" is possibly this way.</para>

        <para>F: This shows an "action" of the rule, a rule consists of a list
        of actions. In this case, we are asserting/inserting a new fact, which
        is a rejection (with the "reason" field set to an explanation). There
        are quite a few other types of actions you can use: you can modify an
        existing fact (which tells the engine the fact has changed) - or you
        can simply set a field on a fact (in which case the engine doesn't
        know about the change - normally because you are setting a result).
        You can also retract a fact. In most cases the green arrow will give
        you a list of fields you can add so you can change the value. The
        values you enter are "literal" - in the sense that what you type is
        what the value is. If it needs to be a calculation, then add an "=" at
        the start of the value - this will be interpreted as a "formula" (for
        advanced users only) ! and the calculation will be performed (not
        unlike a spreadsheet).</para>

        <para>G: This is where the rule options live. In this case, only
        salience is used which is a numeric value representing the rules
        "priority". This would probably be the most common option to
        use.</para>

          <para>Note that is it possible to limit field values to items in a
          pre configured list. This list is configured as part of the package
          (using a data enumeration to provide values for the drop down list).
          These values can be a fixed list, or (for example) loaded from a
          database. This is useful for codes, and other fields where there are
          set values. It is also possible to have what is displayed on screen,
          in a drop down, be different to the value (or code) used in a rule.
          See the section on data enumerations for how these are
          configured.</para>

          <title>Augmenting with DSL sentences</title>

          <para>If the package the rule is part of has a dsl configuration,
          when when you add conditions or actions, then it will provide a list
          of "DSL Sentences" which you can choose from - when you choose one,
          it will add a row to the rule - where the DSL specifies values come
          from a user, then a edit box (text) will be shown (so it ends up
          looking a bit like a form). This is optional, and there is another
          DSL editor. Please note that the DSL capabilities in this editor are
          slightly less then the full set of DSL features (basically you can
          do [when] and [then] sections of the DSL only - which is no
          different to drools 3 in effect).</para>

          <para>The following diagram shows the DSL sentences in action in the
          guided editor:</para>

          </figure>

          <para>In the above example, you can see it is using a mixture of
          literal values, and formulas. The second constraint on the "Person"
          fact, is a formula (in this case it is doing a silly calculation on
          the persons age, and checking something against their name - both
          "age" and "name" are fields of the Person fact in this case. In the
          3rd line (which says "age is less than .." - it is also using a
          formula, although, in this case the formula does a calculation and
          returns a value (which is used in the comparison) - in the former
          case, it had to return True or False (in this case, its a value).
          Obvious formulas are basically pieces of code - so this is for
          experienced users only.</para>

          <para>Looking at the "Board" pattern (the second pattern with the
          horizontal grey bar): this uses a top level conditional element
          ("There is no") - this means that the pattern is actually looking
          for the "non existence" of a fact that matches the pattern. Note the
          "Any of:" - this means that EITHER the "type" field constraint is
          matched, or the "name" field is matched (to "myname" in the case
          above). This is what is termed a Multiple field constraint (you can
          nest these, and have it as complex as you like, depending on how
          much you want the next person to hate you: Some paraphrased advice:
          Write your rules in such as way as if the person who has to
          read/maintain them is a psychopath, has a gun, and knows where you
          live).</para>

          <para>The above dialog is what you will get when you want to add
          constraints to the Person fact. In the top half are the simple
          options: you can either add a field straight away (a list of fields
          of the Person fact will be shown), or you can add a "Multiple field
          constraint" - of a given type (which is described above). The
          Advanced options: you can add a formula (which resolves to True or
          False - this is like in the example above: "age &lt; (age * 2)
          ...."). You can also assign a Variable name to the Person fact
          (which means you can then access that variable on the action part of
          the rule, to set a value etc).</para>

        <title>Spreadsheet decision tables</title>

        <para>Multiple rules can be stored in a spreadsheet (each row is a

        (as there is a separate chapter for them).</para>

        <para>To use a spreadsheet, you upload an xls (and can download the
        current version, as per the picture above). To create a new decision
        table, when you launch the rule wizard, you will get an option to

        <title>Guided decision tables (web based)</title>

        <para>The guided decision table feature allows decision tables to be
        edited in place on the web. This works similar to the guided editor by
        introspecting what facts and fields are available to guide the
        creation of a decision table.</para>

        <title>Rule flows</title>

        <para>Rule flows: Rule flows allow you to visually describe the steps
        taken - so not all rules are evaluated at once, but there is a flow of
        logic. Rule flows are not covered in this chapter on the BRMS, but you
        can use the IDE to graphically draw ruleflows, and upload the .rfm
        file to the BRMS.</para>

        <para>Similar to spreadsheets, you upload/download ruleflow files (the
        eclipse IDE has a graphical editor for them). The details of Rule
        Flows are not discussed here.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Technical rules (drl)</title>

        <para>Technical (drl) rules are stored as text - they can be managed
        in the BRMS. A DRL can either be a whole chunk of rules, or an
        individual rule. if its an individual rule, no package statement or
        imports are required (in fact, you can skip the "rule" statement
        altogether, just use "when" and "then" to mark the condition and
        action sections respectively). Normally you would use the IDE to edit
        raw DRL files, since it has all the advanced tooling and content
        assistance and debugging, however there are times when a rule may have
        to deal with something fairly technical. In any typical package of
        rules, you generally have a been for some "technical rules" - you can
        mix and match all the rule types together of course.</para>

        <title>Data enumerations (drop down list configurations)</title>

        <para>Data enumerations are an optional asset type that technical folk
        can configure to provide drop down lists for the guided editor. These
        are stored and edited just like any other asset, and apply to the
        package that they belong to.</para>

        <para>The contents of an enum config are a mapping of Fact.field to a
        list of values to be used in a drop down. That list can either be
        literal, or use a utility class (which you put on the classpath) to
        load a list of strings. The strings are either a value to be shown on
        a drop down, or a mapping from the code value (what ends up used in
        the rule) and a display value (see the example below, using the
        '=').</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Data enumeration</title>

        </figure>

        <para>In the above diagram - the "MM" indicates a value that will be
        used in the rule, yet "Mini Mal" will be displayed in the GUI.</para>

        <para>Getting data lists from external data sources: It is possible to
        have the BRMS call a piece of code which will load a list of Strings.
        To do this, you will need a bit of code that returns a java.util.List
        (of String's) to be on the classpath of the BRMS. Instead of
        specifying a list of values in the BRMS itself - the code can return
        the list of Strings (you can use the "=" inside the strings if you
        want to use a different display value to the rule value, as normal).
        For example, in the 'Person.age' line above, you could change it to:
        <programlisting> 'Person.age' : (new com.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfAges()</programlisting>
        This assumes you have a class called "DataHelper" which has a method
        "getListOfAges()" which returns a List of strings (and is on the
        classpath). You can of course mix these "dynamic" enumerations with
        fixed lists. You could for example load from a database using JDBC.
        The data enumerations are loaded the first time you use the guided
        editor in a session. If you have any guided editor sessions open - you
        will need to close and then open the rule to see the change. To check
        the enumeration is loaded - if you go to the Package configuration
        screen, you can "save and validate" the package - this will check it
        and provide any error feedback.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Advanced enumeration concepts</title>

        <para>There are a few other advanced things you can do with data
        enumerations.</para>

        <para>Drop down lists that depend on field values: Lets imagine a
        simple fact model, we have a class called Vehicle, which has 2 fields:
        "engineType" and "fuelType". We want to have a choice for the
        "engineType" of "Petrol" or "Diesel". Now, obviously the choice type
        for fuel must be dependent on the engine type (so for Petrol we have
        ULP and PULP, and for Diesel we have BIO and NORMAL). We can express
        this dependency in an enumerattion as:</para>

        <programlisting>
 'Vehicle.engineType' : ['Petrol', 'Diesel']
 'Vehicle.fuelType[engineType=Petrol]' : ['ULP', 'PULP' ]
 'Vehicle.fuelType[engineType=Diesel]' : ['BIO', 'NORMAL' ]  
</programlisting>

        <para>This shows how it is possible to make the choices dependent on
        other field values. Note that once you pick the engineType, the choice
        list for the fuelType will be determined.</para>

        <para>Loading enums programmatically: In some cases, people may want
        to load their enumeration data entirely from external data source
        (such as a relational database). To do this, you can implement a class
        that returns a Map. The key of the map is a string (which is the
        Fact.field name as shown above), and the value is a java.util.List of
        Strings.</para>

        <programlisting>
public class SampleDataSource2 {

  public Map&lt;String&gt;, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; loadData() {
    Map data = new HashMap();

    List d = new ArrayList();
    d.add("value1");
    d.add("value2");
    data.put("Fact.field", d);

    return data;
 }

}
</programlisting>

        <para>And in the enumeration in the brms, you put:</para>

        <programlisting>=(new SampleDataSource2()).loadData()
</programlisting>

        <para>The "=" tells it to load the data by executing your code.</para>

        <para>Mode advanced enumerations: In the above cases, the values in
        the lists are calculated up front. This is fine for relatively static
        data, or small amounts of data. Imagine a scenario where you have
        lists of countries, each country has a list of states, each state has
        a list of localities, each locality has a list of streets and so on...
        You can see how this is a lot of data, and it can not be loaded up.
        The lists should be loaded dependent on what country was selected
        etc...</para>

        <para>Well the above can be addressed in the following fashion:
        <programlisting>
      'Fact.field[dependentField1, dependentField2]' : '(new com.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfAges("@{dependentField1}", "@{dependentField2}")'
    </programlisting> Similar to above, but note that we have just specified
        what fields are needed, and also on the right of the ":" there are
        quotes around the expression. This expression will then be evaluated,
        only when needed, substituting the values from the fields specified.
        This means you can use the field values from the GUI to drive a
        database query, and drill down into data etc. When the drop down is
        loaded, or the rule loaded, it will refresh the list based on the
        fields. 'depenentField1' and 'dependentField2' are names of fields on
        the 'Fact' type - these are used to calculate the list of values which
        will be shown in a drop down if values for the "field".</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Templates of assets/rules</title>

      <para>Tip: As you may have many similar rules, you can create rule
      templates, which are simply rules which are kept in an inactive package
      - you can then categories templates accordingly, and copy them as needed
      (choosing a live package as the target package).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Status management</title>

      <para>Each asset (and also package) in the BRMS has a status flag set.
      The values of the status flag are set in the Administration section of
      the BRMS. (you can add your own status names). Similar to Categories,
      Statuses do NOT effect the execution in any way, and are purely
      informational. Unlike categories, assets only have one status AT A
      TIME.</para>

      <para>Using statuses is completely optional. You can use it to manage
      the lifecycle of assets (which you can alternatively do with categories
      if you like).</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Asset status</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="AssetChangeStatus.png"
                       format="PNG" scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>You can change the status of an individual asset (like in the
      diagram above). Its change takes effect immediately, no separate save is
      needed.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Asset status</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="PackageChangeStatus.png"
                       format="PNG" scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>You can change the status of a whole package - this sets the
      status flag on the package itself, but it ALSO changes the statuses on
      ALL the assets that belong to this package in one hit (to be the same as
      what you set the package to).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Package management</title>

      <para>Configuring packages is generally something that is done once, and
      by someone with some experience with rules/models. Generally speaking,
      very few people will need to configure packages, and once they are
      setup, they can be copied over and over if needed. Package configuration
      is most definitely a technical task that requires the appropriate
      expertise.</para>

      <para>All assets live in "packages" in the BRMS - a package is like a
      folder (it also serves as a "namespace"). A home folder for rule assets
      to live in. Rules in particular need to know what the fact model is,
      what the namespace is etc.</para>

      <para><figure>
          <title>The package explorer</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata align="center" fileref="PackageExplorer.png"
                         format="PNG" scalefit="1" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>The above picture shows the package explorer. Clicking on an
      asset type will show a list of matches (for packages with thousands of
      rules, showing the list may take several seconds - hence the importance
      of using categories to help you find your way around).</para>

      <para>So whilst rules (and assets in general) can appear in any number
      of categories, they only live in one package. If you think of the BRMS
      as a file system, then each package is a folder, and the assets live in
      that folder - as one big happy list of files. When you create a
      deployment snapshot of a package, you are effectively copying all the
      assets in that "folder" into another special "folder".</para>

      <para>The package management feature allows you to see a list of
      packages, and then "expand" them, to show lists of each "type" of asset
      (there are many assets, so some of them are grouped together):</para>

      <para>The asset types: <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Business assets: this shows a list of all "business rule"
            types, which include decision tables, business rules etc.
            etc.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Technical assets: this is a list of items that would be
            considered technical (eg DRL rules, data enumerations and rule
            flows).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Functions: In the BRMS you can also have functions defined
            (optionally of course).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>DSL: Domain Specific Languages can also be stored as an
            asset. If they exist (generally there is only one), then they will
            be used in the appropriate editor GUIs.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Model: A package requires at least one model - for the
            rules.</para>

        </figure> From the package explorer you can create new rules, or new
      assets. Some assets you can only create from the package explorer. The
      above picture shows the icons which launch wizards for this purpose. If
      you hover the mouse over them, a tooltip will tell you what they
      do.</para>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>One of the most critical things you need to do is configure
      packages. This is mostly importing the classes used by the rules, and
      globals variables. Once you make a change, you need to save it, and that
      package is then configured and ready to be built. For example, you may
      add a model which has a class called "com.something.Hello", you would
      then add "import com.something.Hello" in your package configuration and
      save the change.</para>

      <para><figure>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>Finally you would "build" a package. Any errors caught are
      then shown at this point. If the build was successful, then you will
      have the option to create a snapshot for deployment. You can also view
      the "drl" that this package results in. WARNING: in cases of large
      numbers of rules, all these operations can take some time.</para>

      <para>It is optional at this stage to enter the name of a "selector" -
      see the admin section for details on how to configure custom selectors
      for your system (if you need them - selecters allow you to filter down
      what you build into a package - if you don't know what they are for, you
      probably don't need to use them).</para>

      <section>
        <title>Importing drl packages</title>

        <para>It is also possible to create a package by importing an existing
        "drl" file. When you choose to create a new package, you can choose an
        option to upload a .drl file. The BRMS will then attempt to understand
        that drl, break create a package for you. The rules in it will be
        stored as individual assets (but still as drl text content). Note that
        to actually build the package, you will need to upload an appropriate
        model (as a jar) to validate against, as a separate step.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Version management</title>

      <para>Both assets and whole packages of assets are "versioned" in the
      BRMS, but the mechanism is slightly different. Individual assets are
      saved a bit like a version of a file in a source control system.
      However, packages of assets are versioned "on demand" by taking a
      snapshot (typically which is used for deployment). The next section
      talks about deployment management and snapshots.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Asset versions</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="AssetVersionHistory.png"
                       format="PNG" scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Each time you make a change to an asset, it creates a new item in
      the version history. This is a bit like having an unlimited undo. You
      can look back through the history of an individual asset like the list
      above, and view it (and restore it) from that point in time.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Deployment management</title>

      <para>Snapshots, URLS and binary packages:</para>

      <para>URLs are central to how built packages are provided. The BRMS
      provides packages via URLs (for download and use by the Rule Agent).
      These URLs take the form of:
      http://&lt;server&gt;/drools-jbrms/org.drools.brms.JBRMS/package/&lt;packageName&gt;/&lt;packageVersion&gt;</para>

      <para>&lt;packageName&gt; is the name you gave the package.
      &lt;packageVersion&gt; is either the name of a snapshot, or "LATEST" (if
      its LATEST, then it will be the latest built version from the main
      package, not a snapshot). You can use these in the agent, or you can
      paste them into your browser and it will download them as a file.</para>

      <para>Refer to the section on the Rule Agent for details on how you can
      use these URLs (and binary downloads) in your application, and how rules
      can be updated on the fly.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Deployment snapshots</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="Snapshots.png" format="PNG"

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The above shows deployment snapshots view. On the left there is a
      list of packages. Clicking on a specific package will show you a list of
      snapshots for that package (if any). From there you can copy, remove or
      view an asset snapshot. Each snapshot is available for download or
      access via a URL for deployment.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Navigating and finding rules</title>

      <para>The two main ways of viewing the repository are by using
      user-driven Categorization (tagging) as outlined above, and the package
      explorer view.</para>

      <para>The category view provides a way to navigate your rules in a way
      that makes sense to your organization.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Category view</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="CategoryExplorer.png"

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The above diagram shows categories in action. Generally under each
      category you should have no more then a few dozen rules, if
      possible.</para>

      <para>The alternative and more technical view is to use the package
      explorer. This shows the rules (assets) closer to how they are actually
      stored in the database, and also separates rules into packages (name
      spaces) and their type (format, as rules can be in many different
      formats).</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Package view</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The above shows the alternate way of exploring - using
      packages.</para>

  <section>
    <title>The fact model (object model)</title>

    <para>For any rule base application, a fact model is needed to drive the
    rules. The fact model typically overlaps with the applications domain
    model, but in general it will be decoupled from it (as it makes the rules
    easier to manage over time).</para>

    <para>There are 2 ways to to do this: you can upload jar files containing
    classes which your application and the rules both use, or you can use
    models that are declared along with the rules.</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Choosing a model type</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="ModelChooseType.png" format="PNG"
                     scalefit="1" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>When a jar is uploaded, it will add import statements to the package
    configuration (you can then review and change them).</para>

    <para>Using declared models, you will see an editor like the
    following:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Choosing a model type</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="ModelEdit.png" format="PNG"
                     scalefit="1" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>In here you can define types, and add fields (each field has a
    type). The type of a field is suggested by a list (but this list is not
    exhaustive):</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Choosing a model type</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>

                     format="PNG" scalefit="1" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>These fact models can be used like normal fact objects, however the
    way you create them is different (as they are not on your applications
    classpath). To create these objects, they are available from the RuleBase
    instance. <programlisting>
          // Retrieve the generated fact type
        FactType cheeseFact = ruleBase.getFactType( "org.drools.generatedbeans.Cheese" );

        // Create a new Fact instance
        Object cheese = cheeseFact.newInstance();

        cheeseFact.set( cheese,
                        "type",
                        "stilton" );

</programlisting> The "cheese" object above can then be inserted into working
    memory just like a normal pojo based fact.</para>

    <para>Note that the namespace of the declared type is the package
    namespace where it was declared (in the above case
    "org.drools.generatedbeans").</para>

    <para>Why would you chose declared types over jar files: generally this
    reinforces the fact that the model "belongs" to the rulebase, rather then
    the application, and allows the model to have a lifecycle separate from
    the application. It also removed the hassle of keeping jar files in sync
    between rules and the applications that use the rules. </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The business user perspective</title>

    <para>You can see from this manual, that some expertise and practice is
    required to use the BRMS. In fact any software system in some sense
    requires that people be "technical" even if it has a nice looking GUI.
    Having said that, in the right hands the BRMS can be setup to provide a
    suitable environment for non technical users.</para>

    <para>The most appropriate rule formats for this use are using the Guided
    editor, Decision tables and DSL rules. You can use some DSL expressions
    also in the guided editor (so it provides "forms" for people to enter
    values).</para>

    <para>You can use categories to isolate rules and assets from non
    technical users. Only assets which have a category assigned will appear in
    the "categories" view.</para>

    <para>The initial setup of the BRMS will need to be done by a
    developer/technical person who will set the foundations for all the rules.
    They may also create "templates" which are rules which may be copied (they
    would typically live in a "dummy" package, and have a category of
    "template" - this can also help ease the way).</para>

    <para>Deployment should also not be done by non technical users (as
    mentioned previously this happens from the "Package" feature).</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Deployment: Integrating rules with your applications</title>

    <para>Its all very interesting to manage rules, but how to you use or
    "consume" them in your application? This section covers the usage of the
    RuleAgent deployment component that automates most of this for you.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The Rule Agent</title>

      <para>The rule agent is a component which is embedded in the core
      runtime of the rules engine. To use this, you don't need any extra
      components. In fact, if you are using the BRMS, your application should
      only need to include the drools-core dependencies in its classpath
      (drools and mvel jars only), and no other rules specific
      dependencies.</para>

      <para>Note that there is also a drools-ant ant task, so you can build
      rules as part of an ant script (for example in cases where the rules are
      edited in the IDE) without using the BRMS at all - the drools-ant task
      will generate .pkg files the same as the BRMS.</para>

      <para>Once you have "built" your rules in a package in the BRMS (or from
      the ant task), you are ready to use the agent in your target
      application.</para>

      <para>To use the rule agent, you will use a call in your applications
      code like:</para>

      <programlisting>RuleAgent agent = RuleAgent.newRuleAgent("/MyRules.properties");     
RuleBase rb = agent.getRuleBase(); 
rb.newStatefulSession.... 
//now assert your facts into the session and away you go !
</programlisting>

      <para>IMPORTANT: You should only have one instance of the RuleAgent per
      rulebase you are using. This means you should (for example) keep the
      agent in a singleton, JNDI (or similar). In practice most people are
      using frameworks like Seam or Spring - in which case they will take care
      of managing this for you (in fact in Seam - it is already integrated -
      you can inject rulebases into Seam components). Note that the RuleBase
      can be used multiple times by multiple threads if needed (no need to
      have multiple copies of it).</para>

      <para>This assumes that there is a MyRules.properties in the root of
      your classpath. You can also pass in a Properties object with the
      parameters set up (the parameters are discussed next).</para>

      <para>The following shows the content of MyRules.properties:</para>

      <programlisting>##
## RuleAgent configuration file example
##

newInstance=true
file=/foo/bar/boo.pkg /foo/bar/boo2.pkg
dir=/my/dir
url=http://some.url/here http://some.url/here
localCacheDir=/foo/bar/cache
poll=30


name=MyConfig</programlisting>

      <para>You can only have one type of key in each configuration (eg only
      one "file", "dir" etc - even though you can specify multiple items by
      space separating them). Note also, instead of a discrete properties
      file, you can construct a java.utils.Properties object, and pass it in
      to the RuleBase methods.</para>

      <para>Referring to the above example, the "keys" in the properties
      are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>newInstance</para>

          <para>Setting this to "true" means that the RuleBase instance will
          be created fresh each time there is a change. this means you need to
          do agent.getRuleBase() to get the new updated rulebase (any existing
          ones in use will be untouched). The default is false, which means
          rulebases are updated "in place" - ie you don't need to keep calling
          getRuleBase() to make sure you have the latest rules (also any
          StatefulSessions will be updated automatically with rule
          changes).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>file</para>

          <para>This is a space-separated list of files - each file is a
          binary package as exported by the BRMS. You can have one or many.
          The name of the file is not important. Each package must be in its
          own file.</para>

          <para>NOTE: it is also possible to specify .drl files - and it will
          compile it into the package. However, note that for this to work,
          you will need the drools-compiler dependencies in your applications
          classpath (as opposed to just the runtime dependencies).</para>

          <para>Please note that if the path has a space in it, you will need
          to put double quotes around it (as the space is used to separate
          different items, and it will not work otherwise). Generally spaces
          in a path name are best to avoid.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>dir</para>

          <para>This is similar to file, except that instead of specifying a
          list of files you specify a directory, and it will pick up all the
          files in there (each one is a package) and add them to the rulebase.
          Each package must be in its own file.</para>

          <para>Please note that if the path has a space in it, you will need
          to put double quotes around it (as the space is used to separate
          different items, and it will not work otherwise). Generally spaces
          in a path name are best to avoid.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>url</para>

          <para>This is a space separated list of URLs to the BRMS which is
          exposing the packages (see below for more details).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>localCacheDir</para>

          <para>This is used in conjunction with the url above, so that if the
          BRMS is down (the url is not accessible) then if the runtime has to
          start up, it can start up with the last known "good" versions of the
          packages.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>poll</para>

          <para>This is set to the number of seconds to check for changes to
          the resources (a timer is used).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>name</para>

          <para>This is used to specify the name of the agent which is used
          when logging events (as typically you would have multiple agents in
          a system).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Following shows the deployment screen of the BRMS, which provides
      URLs and downloads of packages.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Snapshot deployment</title>

        <mediaobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>You can see the "Package URI" - this is the URL that you would
      copy and paste into the agent .properties file to specify that you want
      this package. It specifies an exact version (in this case to a snapshot)
      - each snapshot has its own URL. If you want the "latest" - then replace
      "NewSnapshot" with "LATEST".</para>

      <para>You can also download a .pkg file from here, which you can drop in
      a directory and use the "file" or "dir" feature of the RuleAgent if
      needed (in some cases people will not want to have the runtime
      automatically contact the BRMS for updates - but that is generally the
      easiest way for many people).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Drools execution server</title>

      <para>The drools execution server (drools-server) module is a war which
      you can deploy to execute knowledgebases (rulebases) remotely for any
      sort of client application. This is not limited to JVM application
      clients, but any technology that can use HTTP, and either XML or JSON.
      Currently this execution server is for stateless sessions (which also
      makes it easy to scale out).</para>

      <para>A "restful" style of interface is provided, with URLs defining
      what knowledgebase is being accessed. Client applications then execute
      knowledgebases remotely via HTTP(S). The rule execution server uses the
      rule agent described in the sections above.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Configuration and deployment</title>

        <para>drools-server is a war file, which can be deployed in a
        application server (such as JBoss AS). As the service is stateless, it
        is possible to have have as many of these services deployed as you
        need to serve the client load. The war file should be expanded to a
        folder for deployment (which will be clear later) - so you can deploy
        this as a folder called drools-server.war.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="running_execution_server.png"

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Once the war has been deployed, you should be able to go to
        http://localhost:8080/drools-server and see a page like the above
        (obviously substitute a correct server address). The page shown should
        provide information on how to use it, and indicates that it is
        healthy.</para>

        <para>To configure a "knowledgebase" - you create a properties file
        with a rule agent configuration in it (see the section above for
        details on the options in the rule agent configuration). The name of
        this properties file will be the name in the URL that you use to
        access this servive. So lets take the example of
        teamallocation.properties: an agent configuration for a service that
        will allocated some piece of work to a team. teamallocation.properties
        should contain details on what packages are to be loaded, and from
        where.</para>

        <para>Place teamallocation.properties in the WEB-INF/classes directory
        in the war directory (and restart the server if needed). Importantly,
        you will ALSO need any jar files that your rules need placed in the
        WEB-INF/lib directory of each execution server instance (eg your
        model, if you are using pojo models, or supporting classes if needed -
        you may not need any). Typically if you are using the execution
        server, your client code will not use a object model jar to talk to
        the service so</para>

        <para>Once this is done, the server is accessed via a url of the
        pattern: http://your-server/drools-server/knowledgebase/{agent
        configuration name}. So in the example above it would be:
        <programlisting>http://your-server/drools-server/knowledgebase/teamallocation</programlisting>
        You can see from this that you can have as many agents configured as
        you like, perhaps for many concurrent versions of
        knowledgebases.</para>

        <title>Consuming the service</title>

        <para>Consuming the service is quite simple, you need to choose to use
        either XML or JSON. By default XML is used, but by setting the
        Content-Type HTTP header to application/json, JSON will be used (JSON
        can be more performant in some circumstances).</para>

        <para>Client libraries: one of the nice things about a REST service is
        that no special client libraries are required, regardless of the
        langugae used. In java however, Apache commons "HttpClient" is
        recommended as an easier API to use then the defaults. Only HTTP is
        required (of course https can be used for secure transport if on an
        untrusted network).</para>

        <para>A sample request:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;knowledgebase-request&gt;
  &lt;globals&gt;
    &lt;named-fact&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;myglobal&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;fact class="org.drools.server.ExampleFact"&gt;
        &lt;carType&gt;Saab&lt;/carType&gt;
        &lt;carPrice&gt;42&lt;/carPrice&gt;
      &lt;/fact&gt;
    &lt;/named-fact&gt;
  &lt;/globals&gt;
  &lt;inOutFacts&gt;
    &lt;named-fact&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;myfact&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;fact class="org.drools.server.ExampleFact"&gt;
        &lt;carType&gt;BMW&lt;/carType&gt;
        &lt;carPrice&gt;50&lt;/carPrice&gt;
      &lt;/fact&gt;
    &lt;/named-fact&gt;
  &lt;/inOutFacts&gt;
  &lt;inFacts&gt;
    &lt;anon-fact&gt;
      &lt;fact class="org.drools.server.ExampleFact"&gt;
        &lt;carType&gt;Audi&lt;/carType&gt;
        &lt;carPrice&gt;55&lt;/carPrice&gt;
      &lt;/fact&gt;
    &lt;/anon-fact&gt;
    &lt;anon-fact&gt;
      &lt;fact class="org.drools.server.ExampleFact"&gt;
        &lt;carType&gt;Mercedes&lt;/carType&gt;
        &lt;carPrice&gt;65&lt;/carPrice&gt;
      &lt;/fact&gt;
    &lt;/anon-fact&gt;
  &lt;/inFacts&gt;
&lt;/knowledgebase-request&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Elements of the request: note that there are 3 parts: globals,
        inOutFacts and inFacts. Both globals and inOutFacts are returned in
        the response message. Globals and inOutFacts are named (each name must
        be unique) for this purpose (in the case of globals, the name of the
        global is the name used in the rules). The "id" tag is used for the
        name. Note that the "fact" tag refers to a fact as used by the
        knowledgebase - the fields inside that enclosing tag are defined by
        the fact class itself. If a fact class has a nested class, then the
        data for that nested data would show up as &lt;nestedFactFieldName&gt;
        - where nestedFactFieldName is the name of the field in the "parent"
        class. Inside that tag are the tags with the values of the fields for
        that nested data (the class name is not needed as that is derived from
        the parent fact).</para>

        <para>A sample response:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;knowledgebase-response&gt;
  &lt;globals&gt;
    &lt;named-fact&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;myglobal&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;fact class="org.drools.server.ExampleFact"&gt;
        &lt;carType&gt;Saab&lt;/carType&gt;
        &lt;carPrice&gt;42&lt;/carPrice&gt;
      &lt;/fact&gt;
    &lt;/named-fact&gt;
  &lt;/globals&gt;
  &lt;inOutFacts&gt;
    &lt;named-fact&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;myfact&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;fact class="org.drools.server.ExampleFact"&gt;
        &lt;carType&gt;BMW&lt;/carType&gt;
        &lt;carPrice&gt;50&lt;/carPrice&gt;
      &lt;/fact&gt;
    &lt;/named-fact&gt;
  &lt;/inOutFacts&gt;
&lt;/knowledgebase-response&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Elements of response: Similar to the request (note the enclosing
        tags are different) - of course only the global and inOutFacts have
        their state returned.</para>

        <para>JSON: (Javascript Object Notation) follows the same basic object
        graph layout as the requests above. Some notes: in JSON, @class is
        used to indicate the type of the fact that the rules use. Also, in
        javascript, associative arrays (maps) are indicated by "{" and "}",
        and arrays via "[" and "]". In some cases, if there would be a list
        (array) but only 1 element of data is present, then "[" will not be
        shown. eg {"a" : "b"} can have the same meaning as [{"a" : "b"}] in
        results.</para>

        <para>A sample request:</para>

        <programlisting>{"knowledgebase-request":
{"globals":{"named-fact":{"id":"myglobal","fact":{"@class":"org.drools.server.ExampleFact","carType":"Saab","carPrice":42}}},
"inOutFacts":{"named-fact":{"id":"myfact","fact":{"@class":"org.drools.server.ExampleFact","carType":"BMW","carPrice":50}}},
"inFacts":{"anon-fact":[{"fact":{"@class":"org.drools.server.ExampleFact","carType":"Audi","carPrice":55}},{"fact":{"@class":"org.drools.server.ExampleFact","carType":"Mercedes","carPrice":65}}]}}}</programlisting>

        <para>A sample response:</para>

        <programlisting>{"knowledgebase-response":
{"globals":{"named-fact":{"id":"myglobal","fact":{"@class":"org.drools.server.ExampleFact","carType":"Saab","carPrice":42}}},
"inOutFacts":{"named-fact":{"id":"myfact","fact":{"@class":"org.drools.server.ExampleFact","carType":"BMW","carPrice":50}}}}}</programlisting>

        <para>Following is an example code snippet showing how a knowledgebase
        is accessed using JSON from Ruby:</para>

        <programlisting>
    require 'json'
    http = Net::HTTP.new('localhost', 8080)
    path = "/drools-server/knowledgebase/teamallocation"
    post_data = {"knowledgebase-request" =&gt; {                     
                  :globals =&gt; {"named-fact" =&gt; [{:id =&gt; "a", :fact =&gt; {"@class" =&gt; "teamallocation.Assignment"}}]},
                  :inFacts =&gt; {"anon-fact" =&gt; [{:fact =&gt; {"@class" =&gt; "teamallocation.Claim", "value" =&gt; 150}}]},
                  :inOutFacts =&gt; {"named-fact" =&gt; [{:id =&gt; "x", :fact =&gt; {"@class" =&gt; "teamallocation.Team", "specialty" =&gt; "FATAL"}},
                                                   {:id =&gt; "y", :fact =&gt; {"@class" =&gt; "teamallocation.Team"}}]}
                                            }                    
                 }
    headers = {
      "Content-Type" =&gt; "application/json"
    }
    resp, data = http.post(path, post_data.to_json, headers)
    
    
    answer = JSON.parse(data)
    #digging out the results:
    puts answer["knowledgebase-response"]["globals"]["named-fact"]["fact"]["teamName"]
    #if there is more then one fact, they are a list
    puts answer["knowledgebase-response"]["inOutFacts"]["named-fact"][0]["fact"]["specialty"]

      <title>JMS, SOAP/WSDL integration</title>

      <para>A stateless rule execution server may not be enough for your
      needs. If you require WSDL+SOAP, JMS or other integration, JBoss ESB
      (http://www.jboss.org/JBossESB/) can be used.</para>

      <para>The esb can provide stateful and stateless rule services via
      multiple transport mechanisms (such as http/soap, or JMS, and many many
      more) as needed. Load balancing, failover, monitoring and more is also
      provided. Refer to the ESB site (http://www.jboss.org/JBossESB/) for
      more information on this (it will not be covered in this manual).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Manual deployment</title>

      <para>This section is only needed for advanced users who are integrating
      deployment into their own mechanism. Normally you should use the rule
      agent.</para>

      <para>For those who do not wish to use the automatic deployment of the
      RuleAgent, "rolling your own" is quite simple. The binary packages
      emitted by the BRMS are serialized Package objects. You can deserialize
      them and add them into any rulebase - essentially that is all you need
      to do.</para>

      <para>From the BRMS, binary packages are provided either from the latest
      version of a package (once you have successfully validated and built a
      package) or from the deployment snapshots. The URLs that the BRMS web
      application exposes provide the binary package via http. You can also
      issue a "HEAD" command to get the last time a package was
      updated.</para>
    </section>

  <section>
    <title>WebDAV and HTTP</title>

    <para>The repository back end can also be accessed via webdav. WebDAV is a
    http based file system API - which has clients on all platforms (some
    operating systems such as windows can connect directly to WebDAV
    repositories almost like a file system.</para>

    <section>
      <title>WebDAV</title>

      <figure>
        <title>Windows webdav</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="WebDAVWindows.png" format="PNG"
                       scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>In windows the "web folders" feature can be used. On OSX - the
      free cyberduck client can work well. To access the repository as webdav,
      you the url is the same as the web interface, only with /webdav at the
      end, instead of Guvnor.html. Authentication will be required to get
      access this way. This will show a packages and snapshots directory - the
      snapshots directory is read only (a view of created snapshots of
      packages). The packages directory will contain a list of packages in the
      repository, drilling in to them will show the individual assets as
      files.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>URLs</title>

      <para>There are a few other URLs which are handy to know exist. The
      package deployment URL mentioned in the section about rule agent
      deployment also has a few other features: By appending .drl to the end
      of a URL, you will show the generated DRL for that package. eg:
      /package/testPDSGetPackage/LATEST.drl - will show the DRL (not the
      binary package) for the latest package. Further to this, you can append
      /assetName.drl - and it will show the generated DRL for that item. (even
      if it isn't a drl file). eg
      /package/testPDSGetPackage/LATEST/SomeFile.drl.</para>
