= Included models in DMN files in {CENTRAL}

In the DMN designer in {CENTRAL}, you can use the *Included Models* tab to include other DMN models and Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can use all of the nodes and logic from both models in the same decision requirements diagram (DRD). When you include a PMML model within a DMN file, you can invoke that PMML model as a boxed function expression for a DMN decision node or business knowledge model node.

You cannot include DMN or PMML models from other projects in {CENTRAL}.
