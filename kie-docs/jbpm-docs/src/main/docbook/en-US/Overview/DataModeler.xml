  <title>Data Modeler</title>

  <para>Neither the Drools platform (the rules engine) nor the jBPM platform
    (the business process engine) make sense if they do not have some kind of
    data to work with.</para>

  <para>Typically, a business process analyst or data analyst will capture the
    requirements for a process or application and turn these into a formal set
    of interrelated data structures. The new Data Modeller tool provides an
    easy, straightforward and visual aid for building both logical and physical
    data models, without the need for advanced development skills or explicit
    coding, and transparently integrate and avail them for use by both
    platforms. Its main goals are to make data models into first class citizens
    in the process improvement cycle and allow for full process automation
    through the integrated use of data structures (and the forms that will be
    used to interact with them - see the chapter on the form modeller).</para>

  <para/>

  <note>
    <para>The data modeller tool effectively replaces the former Drools Fact Modeller.
      The latter is therefore no longer available.</para>
