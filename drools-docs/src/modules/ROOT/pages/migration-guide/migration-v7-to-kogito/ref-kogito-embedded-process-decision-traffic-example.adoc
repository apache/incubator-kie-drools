= Example traffic violations project for the embedded method

The traffic violations project is used as an example for the embedded method of integrating process and decision microservices in {KOGITO}.

In the traffic violations project, first the driver's information is fetched, and based on the fetched information, the driver’s license is validated using a RuleUnit in DRL. After the driver’s license is validated, the violation evaluation is executed that is defined as a DMN decision microservice. The output contains information about whether or not the driver is suspended.

The traffic violations project contains the following microservices:

Process microservices in the traffic violations example::

--
In the traffic violations project, the interactions with the defined decision microservices are executed using the {DECISION_ENGINE}. Also, the information that is required to execute a decision evaluation must be defined in the *Data Assignments* property of the business rule task.

IMPORTANT: The ID property of a process microservice is used to generate the REST endpoint, which refers to the path that is used to interact with the process microservice.

The classes in the process microservice are used to define the Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs), enabling the interaction between the process microservice and decision microservices. The classes include `Violation`, `Driver`, and `Fine`.

The traffic violations example contains license validation as a decision microservice that is created using DRL. The license validation consists of rules that are evaluated to verify whether or not the license is expired and the result is added to the `driver` variable.

Also, the rule units are declared in the `LicenseValidationService.drl` file and the related data is added to the `LicenseValidationService` class.

.Example `LicenseValidationService.drl` file
[source]
----
unit LicenseValidationService

rule "Is driver license valid"
when
    $driver: /driver[licenseExpiration.after(currentTime)]
then
    $driver.setValidLicense(true);
end

rule "Is driver license expired"
when
    $driver: /driver[licenseExpiration.before(currentTime)]
then
    $driver.setValidLicense(false);
end

query "validation"
  $driver : /driver
end
----

.Example `LicenseValidationService` class
[source,java]
----
public class LicenseValidationService implements RuleUnitData {
    private SingletonStore<Driver> driver;

    public LicenseValidationService() {
        this(DataSource.createSingleton());
    }

    public LicenseValidationService(SingletonStore<Driver> driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    public void setDriver(SingletonStore<Driver> driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    public SingletonStore<Driver> getDriver() {
        return driver;
    }

    public Date getCurrentTime() {
        return new Date();
    }
}
----

After validating the license, the traffic violation decision is created using DMN. The traffic violation decision verifies whether or not the driver is suspended. The traffic violation decision is declared in the `TrafficViolation.dmn` file.

In the traffic violations project, the `Violation` class is mapped with the `speedLimit` attribute using the `@JsonProperty` annotation. Therefore, the `speedLimit` attribute can be integrated with the `Violation` data type defined in the DMN model.

[source,java]

public class Violation {

    @JsonProperty("Code")
    private String code;

    @JsonProperty("Date")
    private Date date;

    @JsonProperty("Type")
    private String type;

    @JsonProperty("Speed Limit")
    private BigDecimal speedLimit;

    @JsonProperty("Actual Speed")
    private BigDecimal actualSpeed;

    //Getters / Setters
}

.Violation data type in DMN

In the traffic violations example, when the information of the driver is fetched, an external call to a service task is performed to retrieve the driver information from the database. Also, the service task implementation is performed using the `DriverService` class.

In the data assignments of the service task, `driverId` is defined as an input variable and `driver` is defined as an output variable, consisting of the driver information. Fetching the driver information leads to the license validation task, which represents a task of calling a DRL service.

The properties that are required to set the DRL service task include `Rule Language`, which must be set as `DRL` and the `Rule Flow Group`. You can set the value of `Rule Flow Group` using `unit:` + [the FQCN of the Rule Unit data class] format, for example `unit:org.kie.kogito.traffic.LicenseValidationService`. In the traffic violations example, the `driver` variable contains the license validation information.

Similar to the license validation task, the traffic violation task represents the task of calling a DMN service. The properties that are required to set the DMN service task include `Rule Language`, which must be set as `DMN`. Also, you must set the values for the `Namespace`, `Decision Name`, and `DMN Model Name` properties as defined in the DMN model, such as `TrafficViolation.dmn`. For example, the traffic violations example consists of the following values for the DMN service task (traffic violation task):

* Rule Language: `DMN`
* Namespace: `https://kiegroup.org/dmn/_A4BCA8B8-CF08-433F-93B2-A2598F19ECFF`
* Decision Name: `Traffic Violation`
* DMN Model Name: `Traffic Violation`

The input for the traffic violation task includes `Driver` and `Violation` variables, and the output includes `Suspended` and `Fine` in the *Data Assignment* property.

In both cases, whether the driver is suspended or not, the information is logged in the console.
