= Grafana dashboards for default metrics in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
If any of the Prometheus monitoring modules are imported as dependencies in the `pom.xml` file of your project, some Grafana dashboards that use the default metrics are generated under the folder `target/classes/META-INF/resources/monitoring/dashboards/` every time you compile your {KOGITO} microservice.

Two types of dashboards are exported depending on the decision model used on the endpoints:

* *Operational dashboard*: This dashboard is generated for BPMN, DMN, and DRL endpoints and contains the following metrics:
** Total number of requests on the endpoint
** Average number of requests per minute on the endpoint
** Quantiles on the elapsed time to evaluate the requests
** Exception details

* *Domain-specific dashboard*: This dashboard is exported only for DMN endpoints. The domain-specific dashboard contains a graph for each type of decision in the DMN model. Only the built-in types `number`, `string`, and `boolean` are currently supported.
** If the output of the decision is a `number` type, the graph contains the quantiles for that metric on a sliding window of 3 minutes.
** If the output is a `boolean` or a `string` type, the graph contains the number of occurrences for each output on a 10-minute average.
