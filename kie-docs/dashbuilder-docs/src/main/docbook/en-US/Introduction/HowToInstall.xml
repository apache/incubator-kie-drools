    <title>How to install and run it</title>

    <para>If you want to build the project and execute a quick demo, please,
        proceed as indicated:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Prerequisites:</para>

            <para>This guide assumes you have Java JDK 1.6 (set as JAVA_HOME), a Git
                client and Maven 3.0.5+ (set as MAVEN_HOME) in your system. The
                <emphasis>java</emphasis>
                and
                <emphasis>mvn</emphasis>
                commands must be added to the executable path as well.
            </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            <para>Download the project from the GitHub server:</para>

            <programlisting language="shell">git clone https://github.com/droolsjbpm/dashboard-builder.git</programlisting>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            <para>Open a terminal window, go to the
                <emphasis>scripts</emphasis>
                directory and type the following command:
            </para>

            <programlisting language="shell">./buildandrun.sh h2</programlisting>

            <para>This command compiles, builds and runs the application. This
                procedure will take a few minutes (but only for the first time) because
                of the Maven build process needs to download a lot of third-party
                libraries.
            </para>

            <note>
                <para>The application uses an auto deployable H2 embedded
                    database. So no extra configuration is needed. But when you start the
                    application for the first time it may take some minutes due to the
                    database initialization procedure. The H2 database downgrades the
                    application performance compared with other databases like PostgreSQL,
                    MySQL, normally used in production environments
                </para>
            </note>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            <para>Once the application is started, open a browser and type the
                following URL:
                <programlisting>http://localhost:8080/dashbuilder</programlisting>
            </para>

            <para>The login screen will appear. Login as user
                <emphasis role="bold">root</emphasis>
                and password <emphasis role="bold">root</emphasis>. You'll gain access to the default
                workspace, called <emphasis>Showcase</emphasis>, which contains several
                sample dashboards as well as some administrative tools.
