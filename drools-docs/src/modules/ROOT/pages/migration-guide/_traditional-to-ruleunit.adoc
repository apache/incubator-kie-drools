= Migrate to {PRODUCT} 10

Firstly, migration from {PRODUCT} 8 to {PRODUCT} 10 is very simple. You just need to change the version in `pom.xml`. All APIs and DRL syntax are compatible.

This guide rather focuses on how to migrate from {PRODUCT} 7 projects to {PRODUCT} 10 projects.

{PRODUCT} 10 supports {PRODUCT} 7 APIs and DRL syntax, so basically you don't need to change your Java codes and rule assets. However, there are some cautions in `pom.xml`.

Typical {PRODUCT} 6 or early 7 projects have pom dependencies like this.

.Traditional pom.xml
[xml,subs=attributes+]
----
  </dependencied>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
      <artifactId>drools-core</artifactId>
      <version>${version.org.drools}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
      <artifactId>drools-compiler</artifactId>
      <version>${version.org.drools}</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencied>
----

But since {PRODUCT} 7.45.0, `drools-engine` and `drools-engine-classic` have been introduced as aggregator dependencies. The dependencies `drools-engine-classic`, `drools-mvel` are deprecated starting with {PRODUCT} 8. Hence, use `drools-engine`.

[xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
      <artifactId>drools-engine</artifactId>
      <version>${version.org.drools}</version>
    </dependency>
----

Some module refactoring were made during the version upgrades, so you may find some difficulty in collecting dependencies. This aggregator dependency would help.

== Rule Unit

As introduced in xref:getting-started/index.adoc#first-rule-project_getting-started[First Rule Project], using Rule Units is a recommended style for implementing rules in {PRODUCT} 10. It will require some modifications to your codebase, but if you are going to develop cloud-native applications, Rule Units are strongly recommended, because {KOGITO} also works with Rule Units.

.Rule Unit pom.xml
[xml,subs=attributes+]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
      <artifactId>drools-ruleunits-engine</artifactId>
      <version>${version.org.drools}</version>
    </dependency>
----

`drools-ruleunits-engine` is required for Rule Unit APIs.

Regarding related Java API usage, in {PRODUCT} 7, you create a `KieSession` from rule assets. Then insert facts and fire rules.

.Traditional Java code
[source,java]
----
        KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get();
        KieContainer kcontainer = ks.getKieClasspathContainer();
        KieBase kbase = kcontainer.getKieBase();
        KieSession ksession = kbase.newKieSession();
        try {
            ksession.insert(new Measurement("color", "red"));
            ksession.insert(new Measurement("color", "green"));

            ksession.fireAllRules();
        } finally {
            ksession.dispose();
        }
----

Using Rule Unit APIs, the resulting Java snippet would be like this:

.Rule Unit Java code
[source,java]
----
        MeasurementUnit measurementUnit = new MeasurementUnit();
        try (RuleUnitInstance<MeasurementUnit> instance = RuleUnitProvider.get().createRuleUnitInstance(measurementUnit)) {
            measurementUnit.getMeasurements().add(new Measurement("color", "red"));
            measurementUnit.getMeasurements().add(new Measurement("color", "green"));

            instance.fire();
        } // instance.close() is called automatically
----

In Rule Unit, instantiate `RuleUnitInstance` instead of `KieSession`. Add facts to `DataSource` property instead of `insert`. Generic KIE API calls (e.g. `KieServices`, `KieContainer`, `KieBase` ... ) are no longer needed. Instead, one more class `Unit` has to be defined.

.Rule Unit Class
[source,java]
----
public class MeasurementUnit implements RuleUnitData {

    private final DataStore<Measurement> measurements;
    private final Set<String> controlSet = new HashSet<>();

    public MeasurementUnit() {
        this(DataSource.createStore());
    }

    public MeasurementUnit(DataStore<Measurement> measurements) {
        this.measurements = measurements;
    }

    public DataStore<Measurement> getMeasurements() {
        return measurements;
    }

    public Set<String> getControlSet() {
        return controlSet;
    }
}
----

This Unit class associates rules (`DRL`) and inserted facts (`DataSource`), so it helps you to manage the relationship.

DRL syntax style also changes.

.Traditional DRL
[source]
----
global java.util.Set controlSet;

rule "will execute per each Measurement having ID color"
when
	Measurement( id == "color", $colorVal : val )
then
	controlSet.add($colorVal);
end
----

.Rule Unit DRL
[source]
----
unit MeasurementUnit;

rule "will execute per each Measurement having ID color"
when
	/measurements[ id == "color", $colorVal : val ]
then
	controlSet.add($colorVal);
end
----

Firstly, declare `unit`. Don't need to declare `global`, because `controlSet` is a field of `MeasurementUnit`. Traditional `global` usage would become the Unit's field. In addition, the main difference is OOPath notation in LHS. It is described in detail at xref:language-reference/index.adoc#con-drl-rules-conditions_drl-rules[Rule conditions in DRL]. You should change from the class name (`Measurement`) to the `DataSource` property name in the Unit class (`measurements`).

In addition, you need to take care of the `insert` in RHS. The `insert` method inserts a fact into a "DEFAULT" entry-point, but in Rule Unit use cases, you must specify a `DataSource` where you want to insert the fact. Hence, you must call `DataStore.add` or `DataStream.append` instead of `insert`.

.Traditional DRL
[source]
----
rule "Insert another Measurement"
when
	Measurement( id == "color", $colorVal : val )
then
	insert(new Measurement("monochrome", "false"));
end
----

.Rule Unit DRL
[source]
----
unit MeasurementUnit;

rule "Insert another Measurement"
when
	/measurements[ id == "color", $colorVal : val ]
then
	measurements.add(new Measurement("monochrome", "false"));
end
----

Note that you don't need to re-write `update`, `modify` and `delete`, because they work for a fact in its DataSource expectedly.

These changes are not negligible, but hopefully, as this migration guide demonstrated, they are not so difficult to implement either.
