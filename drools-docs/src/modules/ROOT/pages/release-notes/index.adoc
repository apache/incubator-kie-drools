== Drools 8-series release notes

Drools 8-series is a natural evolution of the 7.x-stream, incorporating many features and lessons learned integrating with Kogito and many cloud-native use cases.

=== Rule Unit

Rule Unit is a central paradigm in the Drools 8-series.
You can refer the xref:migration-guide/index.adoc[Migration guide chapter] for more information about Rule Unit.

=== Minimum requirements update

JDK 11 is now the minimum Java version required to compile Drools and make use of Drools.

Maven `3.8.6` is now the minimum Maven version required to build Drools from source, or using `kie-ci` APIs.

=== `drools-mvel` and `drools-engine-classic` are deprecated

`drools-mvel` is now deprecated in favor of the executable model. It also means `drools-engine` is recommended instead of deprecated `drools-engine-classic` that contains `drools-mvel`. You can still use MVEL syntax in your rules, so it doesn't affect how to write rules.

=== Security Manager deprecation

The {PRODUCT} features related to the JDK Security Manager will not be further developed, as starting with JDK17, the Java Platform has deprecated the Security Manager for removal.
You can refer the xref:KIE/index.adoc#_securitymanager[Security Manager chapter] for more information.

=== KIE Marshallers notice

The `KieMarshallers` are still present and working as expected on the release of the Drools 8-series, however we are currently exploring alternative solutions more idiomatic to cloud-native use cases.

=== {KIE_SERVER} is retired
{KIE_SERVER} is no longer a component of {PRODUCT} 8.  For migration, see xref:migration-guide/index.adoc#kie-server_migration-guide[Migration guide chapter].

=== {BUSINESS_CENTRAL} is retired
{BUSINESS_CENTRAL} is no longer a component of {PRODUCT} 8.  For migration, see xref:migration-guide/index.adoc#business-central_migration-guide[Migration guide chapter].

=== OSGi support is retired
