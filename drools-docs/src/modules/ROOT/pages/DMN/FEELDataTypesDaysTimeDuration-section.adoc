= Days and Time Duration

FEEL does not have _days and time duration_ literals, but the built-in `duration()` function can be used to construct
_days and time duration_ values. For example,

```
duration( "P1DT23H12M30S" )
duration( "P23D" )
duration( "PT12H" )
duration( "PT35M" )
```

_Days and Time Duration_ strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the
https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration[XML Schema Part 2 Datatypes] document, but restricted to only days,
hours, minutes and seconds. Months and years are not allowed.

IMPORTANT: The keyword `dayTimeDuration` is a synonym of `days and time duration`. It is useful when defining a
_days and time duration_ variable in DMN, as the XML schema does not support type names that contain spaces.
