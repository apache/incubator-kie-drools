= Deploying {KOGITO} microservices on OpenShift using binary build and OpenShift web console

OpenShift builds can require extensive amounts of time. As a faster alternative for building and deploying your {KOGITO} microservices on OpenShift, you can use a binary build.

The operator uses the following custom resources to deploy domain-specific microservices (the microservices that you develop):

* `KogitoBuild` processes an uploaded application and produces a runtime image.
* `KogitoRuntime` starts the runtime image and configures it as per your requirements.

.Prerequisites
* The RHPAM Kogito Operator is installed.
* The `oc` OpenShift CLI is installed and you are logged in to the relevant OpenShift cluster. For `oc` installation and login instructions, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.2/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc[OpenShift documentation].
* You have access to the OpenShift web console with the necessary permissions to create and edit `KogitoBuild` and `KogitoRuntime`.
* ({QUARKUS} only) The `pom.xml` file of your project contains the following dependency for the `quarkus-smallrye-health` extension. This extension enables the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes[liveness and readiness probes] that are required for {QUARKUS} projects on OpenShift.

.SmallRye Health dependency for {QUARKUS} applications on OpenShift
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-health</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.Procedure
. Build an application locally.
. Go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* and select *RHPAM Kogito Operator*.
. To create the {KOGITO} build definition, on the operator page, select the *Kogito Build* tab and click *Create KogitoBuild*.
. In the application window, use *Form View* or *YAML View* to configure the build definition.
+
--
At a minimum, define the application configurations shown in the following example YAML file:

.Example YAML definition for a {QUARKUS} application with {KOGITO} build
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: rhpam.kiegroup.org/v1 # {KOGITO} API for this service
kind: KogitoBuild  # Application type
metadata:
  name: example-quarkus  # Application name
spec:
  type: Binary
----

.Example YAML definition for a Spring Boot application with {KOGITO} build
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: rhpam.kiegroup.org/v1 # {KOGITO} API for this service
kind: KogitoBuild  # Application type
metadata:
  name: example-springboot  # Application name
spec:
  runtime: springboot
  type: Binary
----
--

. After you define your application data, click *Create* to generate the {KOGITO} build.
+
Your application is listed in the *{KOGITO}Builds* page. You can select the application name to view or modify application settings and YAML details.

. Upload the built binary using the following command:
+
--
[source]
----
$ oc start-build example-quarkus --from-dir=target/ -n namespace
----

* `from-dir` is equals to the `target` folder path of the built application.
* `namespace` is the namespace where `KogitoBuild` is created.
--

. To create the {KOGITO} microservice definition, on the operator page, select the *Kogito Runtime* tab and click *Create KogitoRuntime*.
. In the application window, use *Form View* or *YAML View* to configure the microservice definition.
+
--
At a minimum, define the application configurations shown in the following example YAML file:

.Example YAML definition for a {QUARKUS} application with {KOGITO} microservices
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: rhpam.kiegroup.org/v1 # {KOGITO} API for this microservice
kind: KogitoRuntime  # Application type
metadata:
  name: example-quarkus  # Application name
----

.Example YAML definition for a Spring Boot application with {KOGITO} microservices
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: rhpam.kiegroup.org/v1 # {KOGITO} API for this microservice
kind: KogitoRuntime  # Application type
metadata:
  name: example-springboot  # Application name
spec:
  runtime: springboot
----

[NOTE]
====
In this case, the application is built locally and deployed using KogitoRuntime. You must ensure that the application name is same in `KogitoBuild` and `KogitoRuntime`.

--

. After you define your application data, click *Create* to generate the {KOGITO} microservice.
+
Your application is listed in the {KOGITO} microservice page. You can select the application name to view or modify application settings and the contents of the YAML file.

. In the left menu of the web console, go to *Builds* -> *Builds* to view the status of your application build.
+
You can select a specific build to view build details.

. After the application build is complete, go to *Workloads* -> *Deployments* to view the application deployments, pod status, and other details.

. After your {KOGITO} microservice is deployed, in the left menu of the web console, go to *Networking* -> *Routes* to view the access link to the deployed application.
+
You can select the application name to view or modify route settings.
+
With the application route, you can integrate your {KOGITO} microservices with your business automation solutions as needed.
