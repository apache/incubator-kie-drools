= Drools documentation website

https://www.drools.org/docs[www.drools.org/docs]

== How it works

pom.xml is configured to generate Antora documentation website using adoc contents under `src/modules`.

`mvn clean package` does the steps:

1. Create `antora.yml` file based on `antora-template.yml`
2. install `node`, `npm` and `antora`
3. Execute antora to generate a documentation website

A start page of the generated site would be `target/website/docs/index.html`.

To simplify the maintenance, the documentation website is based on a pre-built default Antora UI bundle
located in `ui-bundle/ui-bundle.zip`. Customizations are located in `supplemental-ui` that Antora uses to replace
parts of the default `ui-bundle.zip`.
