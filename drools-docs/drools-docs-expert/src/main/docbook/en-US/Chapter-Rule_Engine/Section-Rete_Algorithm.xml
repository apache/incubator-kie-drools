  <title>Rete Algorithm</title>

  <para>The <emphasis>Rete</emphasis> algorithm was invented by Dr. Charles Forgy and documented in
  his PhD thesis in 1978-79. A simplified version of the paper was published
  in 1982 (<ulink
  url="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/505087/0">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/505087/0</ulink>).
  The latin word "rete" means "net" or "network". The Rete algorithm can be
  broken into 2 parts: rule compilation and runtime execution.</para>

  <para>The compilation algorithm describes how the Rules in the Production
  Memory are processed to generate an efficient discrimination network. In
  non-technical terms, a discrimination network is used to filter data as 
  it propagates through the network. The nodes at the top of the network
  would have many matches, and as we go down the network, there would be 
  fewer matches. At the very bottom of the network are the terminal nodes. In Dr.
  Forgy's 1982 paper, he described 4 basic nodes: root, 1-input, 2-input and
  terminal.</para>

  <para>The root node is where all objects enter the network. From there, it
  immediately goes to the ObjectTypeNode. The purpose of the ObjectTypeNode is
  to make sure the engine doesn't do more work than it needs to. For example,
  say we have 2 objects: Account and Order. If the rule engine tried to
  evaluate every single node against every object, it would waste a lot of
  cycles. To make things efficient, the engine should only pass the object to
  the nodes that match the object type. The easiest way to do this is to
  create an ObjectTypeNode and have all 1-input and 2-input nodes descend from
  it. This way, if an application asserts a new Account, it won't propagate to
  the nodes for the Order object. In Drools when an object is asserted it
  retrieves a list of valid ObjectTypesNodes via a lookup in a HashMap from
  the object's Class; if this list doesn't exist it scans all the ObjectTypeNodes finding valid matches which it caches in the list. This enables Drools
  to match against any Class type that matches with an
  <literal>instanceof</literal> check.</para>

  <para>ObjectTypeNodes can propagate to AlphaNodes, LeftInputAdapterNodes
  and BetaNodes. AlphaNodes are used to evaluate literal conditions. Although
  the 1982 paper only covers equality conditions, many RETE implementations
  support other operations. For example, <code>Account.name == "Mr Trout"</code> is a
  literal condition. When a rule has multiple literal conditions for a single
  object type, they are linked together. This means that if an application
  asserts an Account object, it must first satisfy the first literal condition
  before it can proceed to the next AlphaNode. In Dr. Forgy's paper, he refers
  to these as IntraElement conditions. The following diagram shows the AlphaNode
  combinations for Cheese( name == "cheddar", strength == "strong" ):</para>

  <para>Drools extends Rete by optimizing the propagation from ObjectTypeNode
  to AlphaNode using hashing. Each time an AlphaNode is added to an
  ObjectTypeNode it adds the literal value as a key to the HashMap with the
  AlphaNode as the value. When a new instance enters the ObjectType node,
  rather than propagating to each AlphaNode, it can instead retrieve the
  correct AlphaNode from the HashMap,thereby avoiding unnecessary literal
  checks.</para>

  <para>There are two two-input nodes, JoinNode and NotNode, and both are
  types of BetaNodes. BetaNodes are used to compare 2 objects, and their
  fields, to each other. The objects may be the same or different types. By
  convention we refer to the two inputs as left and right. The left input for
  a BetaNode is generally a list of objects; in Drools this is a Tuple. The
  right input is a single object. Two Nodes can be used to implement 'exists'
  checks. BetaNodes also have memory. The left input is called the Beta Memory
  and remembers all incoming tuples. The right input is called the Alpha
  Memory and remembers all incoming objects. Drools extends Rete by
  performing indexing on the BetaNodes. For instance, if we know that a
  BetaNode is performing a check on a String field, as each object enters we
  can do a hash lookup on that String value. This means when facts enter from
  the opposite side, instead of iterating over all the facts to find valid
  joins, we do a lookup returning potentially valid candidates. At any
  point a valid join is found the Tuple is joined with the Object; which is
  referred to as a partial match; and then propagated to the next node.</para>

  <para>To enable the first Object, in the above case Cheese, to enter the
  network we use a LeftInputNodeAdapter - this takes an Object as an input and
  propagates a single Object Tuple.</para>

  <para>Terminal nodes are used to indicate a single rule having matched all its
  conditions; at this point we say the rule has a full match. A rule with an
  'or' conditional disjunctive connective results in subrule generation for
  each possible logically branch; thus one rule can have multiple terminal
  nodes.</para>

  <para>Drools also performs node sharing. Many rules repeat the same
  patterns, and node sharing allows us to collapse those patterns so that they
  don't have to be re-evaluated for every single instance. The following two
  rules share the first pattern, but not the last:</para>

  <programlisting>
    <![CDATA[
    rule
    when
        Cheese( $chedddar : name == "cheddar" )
        $person : Person( favouriteCheese == $cheddar )
    then
        System.out.println( $person.getName() + " likes cheddar" );
    end
    ]]>
   </programlisting>

  <programlisting>
    <![CDATA[
    rule
    when
        Cheese( $chedddar : name == "cheddar" )
        $person : Person( favouriteCheese != $cheddar )
    then
        System.out.println( $person.getName() + " does not like cheddar" );
    end
    ]]>
  </programlisting>

  <para>As you can see below, the compiled Rete network shows that the alpha node is
  shared, but the beta nodes are not. Each beta node has its own TerminalNode. Had
  the second pattern been the same it would have also been shared.</para>
