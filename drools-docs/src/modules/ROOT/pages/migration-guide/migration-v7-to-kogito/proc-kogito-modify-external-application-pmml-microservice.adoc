= Modifying an external application to a {KOGITO} microservice

[role="_abstract"]
After deploying the PMML microservice, you need to modify the external application to a {KOGITO} deployment.

.Prerequisites
* The original external application must be implemented on the {KIE_SERVER} client API.

.Procedure
. Remove all the usage of the {KIE_SERVER} client API and replace it with the HTTP communication. The following is an example of a non-Java request:

. Ensure that any HTTP client Java library is used inside the external application to create a similar invocation and parse the result.
