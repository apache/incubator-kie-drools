= Built-in functions in FEEL

[role="_abstract"]
To promote interoperability with other platforms and systems, Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) includes a library of built-in functions. The built-in FEEL functions are implemented in the Drools Decision Model and Notation (DMN) engine so that you can use the functions in your DMN decision services.

For detailed information about FEEL and built-in FEEL functions in DMN, you can reference the https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#dmn-feel-handbook[Drools DMN engine, DMN FEEL handbook].
