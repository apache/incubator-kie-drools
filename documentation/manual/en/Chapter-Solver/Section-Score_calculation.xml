    <title>Rule based score calculation</title>

    <para>Score calculation of a planning problem is based on constraints
    (such as hard constraints, soft constraints, rewards, ...). A rules
    engine, such as drools, makes it easy to implement those constraints as
    <emphasis>score rules</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Here's an example of a constraint implemented as a score rule in
    drools:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Score rule for multiple queens on the same horizontal
      line</title>

      <programlisting>rule "multipleQueensHorizontal"
  when
    $q1 : Queen($id : id, $y : y);
    $q2 : Queen(id &gt; $id, y == $y);
  then
    // trigger a change in the score
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>This score rule will fire once for every 2 queens with the same
    <literal>y</literal>. The <literal>(id &gt; $id)</literal> condition is
    needed to assure that for 2 queens a and b, it can only fire for (a,b) and
    not for (b,a), (a,a) or (b,b). Let's take a closer look at this score rule
    on the starting solution of 4 queens:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Starting solution for the 4 queens puzzle</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="unsolvedNQueens04.svg" format="SVG" />
        </imageobject>

        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="unsolvedNQueens04.png" format="PNG" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>In this starting solution the multipleQueensHorizontal score rule
    will fire for 6 queen couples: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D) and
    (C, D). Because none of the queens are on the same vertical or diagonal
    line, this starting solution will have a score of <literal>-6</literal>.
    An optimal solution of 4 queens has a score of <literal>0</literal>. More
    on that later.</para>

    <para>You need to add your score rules drl files in the solver
    configuration, for example:</para>

    <programlisting>    &lt;scoreDrl&gt;/org/drools/solver/examples/nqueens/solver/nQueensScoreRules.drl&lt;/scoreDrl&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>You can add multiple <literal>&lt;scoreDrl&gt;</literal> entries if
    needed.</para>

    <para>It's recommended to use drools in forward-chaining mode (which is
    the default behaviour), as for most solver implementations this will
    create the effect of a <emphasis>delta based score calculation</emphasis>
    instead of a full score calculation on each solution evaluation. For
    example, if a single queen moves from y <literal>0</literal> to
    <literal>3</literal>, it won't bother to recalculate the "multiple queens
    on the same horizontal line" constraint for queens with y
    <literal>1</literal> or <literal>2</literal>. This is a huge performance
    gain. <emphasis role="bold">Drools-solver gives you this huge performance
    gain without forcing you to write a very complicated delta based score
    calculation algorithm.</emphasis> Just let the drools rule engine do the
    hard work.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Adding more constraints is <emphasis
    role="bold">easy and </emphasis>scalable</emphasis> (if you understand the
    drools rule syntax). This allows you to add it a bunch of soft constraint
    score rules on top of the hard constraints score rules with little effort
    and a reasonable performance cost. For example, for a freight routing
    problem you could add a soft constraint to avoid the certain flagged
    highways at rush hour.</para>

    <title>The ScoreCalculator interface</title>

    <para>The <literal>ScoreCalculator</literal> interface allows the solver
    to calculate the score of the currently evaluated solution. The score must
    a <literal>Number</literal> instance and the instance type (for example
    <literal>Double</literal> or <literal>Integer</literal>) must be stable
    throughout the problem.</para>

    <para>The solver aims to find the solution with the highest score.
    <emphasis>The best solution</emphasis> is the solution with the highest
    score that it encounters during its solving.</para>

    <para>Most planning problems tend to use negative scores (the amount of
    negative constraints being broken) with an impossible perfect score of 0.
    This is why the score of a solution of 4 queens is the negative of the
    number of queen couples that can attack each other.</para>

    <para>A <literal>ScoreCalculator</literal> instance is configured in the
    solver configuration:</para>

    <programlisting>    &lt;scoreCalculator&gt;
        &lt;scoreCalculatorType&gt;SIMPLE&lt;/scoreCalculatorType&gt;
    &lt;/scoreCalculator&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>There are a couple of build-in <literal>ScoreCalculator</literal>
    implementations:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>SIMPLE: A <literal>SimpleScoreCalculator</literal> instance
        which has a <literal>setScore(Number)</literal> method for use in the
        score rules.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>HARD_AND_SOFT_CONSTRAINTS: A
        <literal>HardAndSoftConstraintScoreCalculator</literal> instance,
        which has a <literal>setHardConstraintsBroken(Number)</literal> and a
        <literal>setSoftConstraintsBroken(Number)</literal> method for use in
        the score rules.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DYNAMIC_HARD_AND_SOFT_CONSTRAINTS: A special
        <literal>HardAndSoftConstraintScoreCalculator</literal> instance, for
        more information see the javadocs.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>You can plug in your own custom <literal>ScoreCalculator</literal>
    too.</para>

    <para>The <literal>ScoreCalculator</literal> instance is asserted into the
    working memory as a global called <literal>scoreCalculator</literal>. Your
    score rules will (indirectly) update that instance. Usually you 'll make a
    single rule as an aggregation of the other rules to update the
    score:</para>

    <programlisting>global SimpleScoreCalculator scoreCalculator;

rule "multipleQueensHorizontal"
  when
    $q1 : Queen($id : id, $y : y);
    $q2 : Queen(id &gt; $id, y == $y);
  then
    insertLogical(new WorkaroundMultiplePatternAccumulate("multipleQueensHorizontal", $q1, $q2));
end

rule "multipleQueensAscendingDiagonal"
  // ...
end

rule "multipleQueensDescendingDiagonal"
  // ...
end

rule "constraintsBroken"
  when
    $hardConstraintCount : Number() from accumulate(
       $w : WorkaroundMultiplePatternAccumulate(),
       count($w)
    );
  then
    scoreCalculator.setScore(- $hardConstraintCount);
end</programlisting>

    <para>You can also weigh your constraints differently, by multiplying the
    count of each score rule with its weight. For example in freight routing,
    you can make 5 broken "avoid crossroads" soft constraints count as much as
    1 broken "avoid highways at rush hour" soft constraint.</para>

    <para>Here's an example of all the NQueens constraints written as a single
    rule, using multi pattern accumulates and making multipleQueensHorizontal
    constraint outweigh the other constraints 5 times:</para>

    <programlisting>// Warning: This currently triggers backwards chaining instead of forward chaining and seriously hurts performance and scalability.
rule "constraintsBroken"
  when
    $multipleQueensHorizontal : Long()
    from accumulate(
        $q1 : Queen($id : id, $y : y)
        and Queen(id &gt; $id, y == $y),
       count($q1)
    );
    $multipleQueensAscendingDiagonal : Long()
    from accumulate(
        $q2 : Queen($id : id, $ascendingD : ascendingD)
        and Queen(id &gt; $id, ascendingD == $ascendingD),
       count($q2)
    );
    $multipleQueensDescendingDiagonal : Long()
    from accumulate(
        $q3 : Queen($id : id, $descendingD : descendingD)
        and Queen(id &gt; $id, descendingD == $descendingD),
       count($q3)
    );
  then
    scoreCalculator.setScore(- (5 * $multipleQueensHorizontal) - $multipleQueensAscendingDiagonal - $multipleQueensDescendingDiagonal);
end</programlisting>

    <title>Tips and tricks</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If you know a certain constraint can never be broken, don't
        bother writing a score rule for it. For example the NQueens example
        doesn't have a "multipleQueensVertical" rule because a queen's
        <literal>x</literal> never changes. This gives a performance gain,
        because</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Verify that your score calculation happens in the correct Number
        type. If you're making the sum of nothing but integer values, don't
        let drools use Double's or your performance will hurt.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In case you haven't figured it out yet: performance (and
        scalability) is very important for solving planning problems. What
        good is a real-time freight routing solver that takes a day to find a
        feasible solution? Even small and innocent looking problems can hide
        an enormous problem size. For example, they probably still don't know
        the optimal solution of the traveling tournament problem for as little
        as 10 traveling teams. But always remember that premature optimization
        is the root of all evil.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Currently, don't allow drools to switch to MVEL mode, for
        performance. You can avoid this by using <literal>eval</literal>, for
        example: <literal>eval(day.getIndex() == $day1.getIndex() +
        3)</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Currently, don't allow drools to backward chain instead of
        forward chain, so avoid query's.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If performance is important (and it will), use at least java 1.6
        and always use server mode (<literal>java -server</literal>). We have
        seen performance increases of 30% by switching from java 1.5 to 1.6
        and 50% by turning on server mode.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If you're doing performance tests, always remember that the JVM
        needs to warm up. First load your solver and do a short run, before
        you start benchmarking it.</para>
