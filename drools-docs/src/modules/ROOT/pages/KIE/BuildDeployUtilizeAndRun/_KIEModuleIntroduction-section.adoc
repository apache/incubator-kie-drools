[[_kiemoduleintroductionbuildingintroductionsection]]
= Introduction

{PRODUCT} since version `6.0` introduced a new configuration and convention approach to building KIE bases, instead of using the programmatic builder approach of the `5.x` series.
// The builder is still available to fall back on, as it's used for the tooling integration.

Building {PRODUCT}-based KIE project make use of Maven, and aligns with Maven practices.
A KIE project or module is simply a Maven Java project or module; with an additional metadata file META-INF/kmodule.xml.
The kmodule.xml file is the descriptor that selects resources to KIE bases and configures those KIE bases and sessions.

While standard Maven can build and package KIE resources, it will not provide validation at build time.
There is a Maven plugin (`kie-maven-plugin`) which is recommended to use to get build time validation.
The plugin also generates many classes, making the runtime loading faster too.

The example project layout and Maven POM descriptor is illustrated in the screenshot

KIE uses defaults to minimise the amount of configuration.
With an empty kmodule.xml being the simplest configuration.
There must always be a kmodule.xml file, even if empty, as it's used for discovery of the JAR and its contents.

Maven can either 'mvn install' to deploy a KieModule to the local machine, where all other applications on the local machine use it.
Or it can 'mvn deploy' to push the KieModule to a remote Maven repository.
Building the Application will pull in the KieModule and populate the local Maven repository in the process.

JARs can be deployed in one of two ways.
Either added to the classpath, like any other JAR in a Maven dependency listing, or they can be dynamically loaded at runtime.
KIE will scan the classpath to find all the JARs with a kmodule.xml in it.
Each found JAR is represented by the KieModule interface.
The terms classpath KieModule and dynamic KieModule are used to refer to the two loading approaches.
While dynamic modules support side by side versioning, classpath modules do not.
Further once a module is on the classpath, no other version may be loaded dynamically.

Detailed references for the API are included in the next sections, the impatient can jump straight to the examples section, which is fairly self-explanatory on the different use cases.
