KIE :: Download Maven Plugin
============================================

This plugin is used to download resources from arbitrary URLs.
It is actually an extension of the [download-maven-plugin](https://github.com/download-maven-plugin/download-maven-plugin), with the difference that it allows multiple URLs to be defined for the same file, to have fallbacks.
