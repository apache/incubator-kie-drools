= Project storage and build options with {PRODUCT}

As you develop a {PRODUCT} project, you need to be able to track the versions of your project with a version-controlled repository, manage your project assets in a stable environment, and build your project for testing and deployment. You can use {CENTRAL} for all of these tasks, or use a combination of {CENTRAL} and external tools and repositories. {PRODUCT} supports Git repositories for project version control, Apache Maven for project management, and a variety of Maven-based, Java-based, or custom-tool-based build options.

The following options are the main methods for {PRODUCT} project versioning, storage, and building:

|{CENTRAL} Git VFS
|{CENTRAL} contains a built-in Git Virtual File System (VFS) that stores all processes, rules, and other artifacts that you create in the authoring environment. Git is a distributed version control system that implements revisions as commit objects. When you commit your changes into a repository, a new commit object in the Git repository is created. When you create a project in {CENTRAL}, the project is added to the Git repository connected to {CENTRAL}.

|External Git repository
|If you have {PRODUCT} projects in Git repositories outside of {CENTRAL}, you can import them into {PRODUCT} spaces and use Git hooks to synchronize the internal and external Git repositories.

|{CENTRAL} Maven repository
a|{CENTRAL} contains a built-in Maven repository that organizes and builds project assets that you create in the authoring environment. Maven is a distributed build-automation tool that uses repositories to store Java libraries, plug-ins, and other build artifacts. When building projects and archetypes, Maven dynamically retrieves Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from local or remote repositories to promote shared dependencies across projects.

NOTE: For a production environment, consider using an external Maven repository configured with {CENTRAL}.

|Embedded Java application (KJAR)
|If you have an embedded Java application from which you want to build your {PRODUCT} project, you can use a `KieModuleModel` instance to programatically create a `kmodule.xml` file with the KIE base and KIE session configurations, and then add all resources in your project to the KIE virtual file system `KieFileSystem` to build the project.

|S2I in OpenShift (container image)
|If you use {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, you can build your {PRODUCT} projects as KJAR files in the typical way or use Source-to-Image (S2I) to build your projects as container images. S2I is a framework and a tool that allows you to write images that use the application source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled application as an output. The main advantage of using the S2I tool for building reproducible container images is the ease of use for developers.
