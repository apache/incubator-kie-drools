/**
 * <p>
 * The KnowledgeBuilder is responsible for taking source files, such as a .drl file, a .bpmn2 file or an .xls file,
 * and turning them into a KnowledgePackage of rule and process definitions which a KnowledgeBase
 * can consume. It uses the ResourceType enum to tell it the type of the resource it is being asked to build.
 * 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The ResourceFactory provides capabilities to load Resources from a number of sources; such as
 * Reader, ClassPath, URL, File, ByteArray. Binaries, such as XLS decision tables,
 * should not use a Reader based Resource handler, which is only suitable for text based resources.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is best practice to always check the hasErrors() method after an addition, you should not add 
 * more resources or get the KnowledgePackages if there are errors. getKnowledgePackages() will return 
 * an empty list if there are errors.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can create a new KnowledgeBase for all the resources that were added using this builder using
 * the newKnowledgeBase() method.  This will throw an exception if there are errors for any of the
 * resources.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Simple example showing how to build a KnowledgeBase from an DRL rule resource.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
 * kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newUrlResource( "file://myrules.drl" ),
 *                       ResourceType.DRL);
 * assertFalse( kbuilder.hasErrors() );
 * KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Simple example showing how to build a KnowledgeBase from an XLS decision table resource.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
 * DecisionTableConfiguration dtconf = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newDecisionTableConfiguration();
 * dtconf.setInputType( DecisionTableInputType.XLS );
 * dtconf.setWorksheetName( "Tables_2" );
 * kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newUrlResource( "file://IntegrationExampleTest.xls" ),
 *               ResourceType.DTABLE,
                 dtconf );
 * assertFalse( kbuilder.hasErrors() );
 * KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Simple example showing how to build a KnowledgeBase from an BPMN2 process resource.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
 * kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newUrlResource( "file://myProcess.bpmn2" ),
 *               ResourceType.BPMN2 );
 * KnowledgeBase kbase = kbuilder.newKnowledgeBase();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If there are errors a simple toString can print the errors
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * if ( kbuilder.hasErrors() ) {
 *     log.exception( kbuilder.getErrors().toString() )
 * }
 * </pre>     
 * 
 * <p>
 * The KnowledgeBuilder can also be built from a configuration using the XML change-set format and
 * the ResourceType.CHANGE_SET value. While change-set supports add, remove, and modify as elements.
 * KnowledgeBuilder will only process add. If the resource element provided points to a directory, all
 * files found in that directory will be added. Currently the knowledge type is not derived from the
 * file extension and must be explicitly set in the XML for the resource. It is expected that all
 * resources in a directory given resource are of the specified type.
