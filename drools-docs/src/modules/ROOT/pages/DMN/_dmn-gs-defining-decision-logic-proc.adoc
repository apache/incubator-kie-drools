= Defining the traffic violations DMN decision logic

To calculate the fine and to decide whether the driver is to be suspended or not, you can define the traffic violations DMN decision logic using a DMN decision table and context boxed expression.

.Should the driver be suspended expression

.Prerequisites
* You have assigned the DMN custom data types to the appropriate decision and input nodes in the traffic violations DRD in {DMN_EDITOR}.

.Procedure
. To calculate the fine, in the DMN designer canvas, select the *Fine* decision node and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression designer.

. Click *Select expression* -> *Decision Table*.

. For the *Violation.Date*, *Violation.Code*, and *Violation.Speed Limit* columns, right-click and select *Delete* for each field.
. Click the *Violation.Actual Speed* column header and enter the expression `Violation.Actual Speed - Violation.Speed Limit` in the *Expression* field."
. Enter the following values in the first row of the decision table:
* *Violation.Type*: `"speed"`
* *Violation.Actual Speed - Violation.Speed Limit*: `[10..30)`
* *Amount*: `500`
* *Points*: `3`
+
Right-click the first row and select `Insert below` to add another row.
. Enter the following values in the second row of the decision table:
* *Violation.Type*: `"speed"`
* *Violation.Actual Speed - Violation.Speed Limit*: `>= 30`
* *Amount*: `1000`
* *Points*: `7`
+
Right-click the second row and select `Insert below` to add another row.
. Enter the following values in the third row of the decision table:
* *Violation.Type*: `"parking"`
* *Violation.Actual Speed - Violation.Speed Limit*: `-`
* *Amount*: `100`
* *Points*: `1`
+
Right-click the third row and select `Insert below` to add another row.
. Enter the following values in the fourth row of the decision table:
* *Violation.Type*: `"driving under the influence"`
* *Violation.Actual Speed - Violation.Speed Limit*: `-`
* *Amount*: `1000`
* *Points*: `5`
. Click *Save*.
. To define the driver suspension rule, return to the DMN designer canvas, select the *Should the driver be suspended?* decision node, and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression designer.
. Click *Select expression* -> *Context*.
. Click *ContextEntry-1*, enter `Total Points` as the *Name*, and select `number` from the *Data Type* drop-down menu.
. Click the cell next to *Total Points*, select `Literal expression` from the context menu, and enter `Driver.Points + Fine.Points` as the expression.
. In the cell below *Driver.Points + Fine.Points*, select `Literal Expression` from the context menu, and enter `if Total Points >= 20 then "Yes" else "No"`.
. Click *Save*.

You have defined how to calculate the fine and the context for deciding when to suspend the driver. You can navigate to the *traffic-violation* project page and click *Build* to build the example project and address any errors noted in the *Alerts* panel.
