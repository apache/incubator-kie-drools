	* labels.xsl: Number figures, examples, and tables from book if there is no prefix (i.e. if chapter.autolabel is set to 0). This avoids having the list of figures where the figures mysteriously restart their numeration periodically when chapter.autolabel is set to 0.

2005-06-30  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* labels.xsl: Gave procedure its own label.markup template because it
	should not count procedures without  title.

2005-06-28  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile: "clean" target now deletes $(SOURCES) xml files instead of doing a
	blanket "rm -f *.xml", which was causing hte l10n.xml file to be
	deleted. That file is under version control, so deleting it was
	forcing you to do a "cvs update" after you run "make clean". if
	you forget, it screws up the build.

2005-06-28  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* olink.xsl: Don't add docname to olink when pointing to root element.

2005-06-06  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-05-28  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pi.xsl: Context node must be stored/restored in order to get correct language code. (Note that for-each changes current node.)

2005-05-26  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* l10n.xsl: Make language codes RFC compliant (closes #1208931; thanks to
	Bernd Groh for reporting).
	
	::PROBLEM:
	  Stylesheets output two-part language codes in the form "zh_CN".
	  But underscores in language codes are actually neither RFC
	  compliant nor compliant with the HTML 4.0 rec. The separator
	  should be a hyphen. To quote the specs:
	
	    Section 8.1.1, "Language Codes"[1], in the HTML 4.0 Rec.
	    states that:
	
	    [RFC1766] defines and explains the language codes that MUST be
	    used in HTML documents.
	
	    Briefly, language codes consist of a primary code and a
	    possibly empty series of subcodes:
	
	      language-code = primary-code ( "-" subcode )*
	
	    And in RFC 1766, "Tags for the Identification of
	    Languages"[2], the EBNF for "language tag" is given as:
	
	      Language-Tag = Primary-tag *( "-" Subtag )
	      Primary-tag = 1*8ALPHA
	      Subtag = 1*8ALPHA
	
	    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1.1
	    [2] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1766.txt
	
	::CAUSE:
	  Stylesheets simply pass through language codes unaltered. So if
	  users put "zh_CN" in their source, they will get "zh_CN" in
	  their HTML output.
	
	::FIX:
	  Added a new boolean config parameter, "l10n.lang.value.rfc.compliant",
	  set to 1 by default. If it is non-zero, any underscore in a
	  language code will be converted to a hyphen in HTML output. If
	  it is zero, the language code will be left as-is.
	
	::AFFECTS:
	  This change affects any HTML output that contains two-part
	  language codes.

2005-05-24  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* common.xsl: Support generation of choice separator in inline simplelist
	(closes #1207532)
	
	This ehancement enables auto-generation of an appropriate
	localized "choice separator" (for example, "and" or
	"or") before the final item in an inline simplelist.
	
	To indicate that you want a choice separator generated
	for a particular list, you need to put a processing
	instruction (PI) of the form <?dbchoice choice="foo"?>
	as a child a of the list. For example:
	
	  <para>This release adds localiation support for the
	  following Indic languages:
	    <simplelist type="inline">
	      <?dbchoice choice="and" ?>
	      <member>Hindi</member>
	      <member>Punjabi</member>
	      <member>Tamil</member>
	      <member>Oriya</member>
	      <member>Gujarati</member>
	    </simplelist>.
	  </para>
	
	Output (for English):
	
	  This release adds localiation support for the
	  following Indic languages: Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil,
	  Oriya, and Gujarati.
	
	Or if the logical relationship between the items in the
	list is an "or" relationship, then use choice="or":
	
	  <para>Choose from ONE and ONLY ONE of the following:
	    <simplelist type="inline">
	      <?dbchoice choice="or" ?>
	      <member>A</member>
	      <member>B</member>
	      <member>C</member>.
	    </simplelist>
	  </para>
	
	Output (for English):
	
	  Choose from ONE and only ONE of the
	  following choices: A, B, or C.
	
	As a temporary workaround for the fact that most of the
	DocBook non-English locale files don't have a
	localization for the word "or", you can put in a
	literal string to be used; example for French:
	
	  <para>Choose from ONE and ONLY ONE of the following:
	    <simplelist type="inline">
	      <?dbchoice choice="ou" ?>
	      <member>A</member>
	      <member>B</member>
	      <member>C</member>.
	    </simplelist>
	  </para>
	
	That is, use "ou" instead of "or".

2005-05-23  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pi.xsl: Minor update to date/time handling.

	* pi.xsl: Make handling of date format strings more robust (closes #1206837).
	
	::Problem:
	  If the "dbtimestamp" PI has words in it that contain any of the
	  single-letter characters used as date/time formatting
	  instructions, the output is not what would be expected.
	
	  For example, Spanish "long" dates look like this:
	
	    23 de mayo de 2005
	
	  So you would expect that you could generate a date of that form
	  using the dbtimestamp PI with a format string like the following:
	
	    <?dbtimestamp format="d de B de Y"?>
	
	  But if you try that, you get the following output:
	
	    23 23e mayo 23e 2005
	
	  That is, the "d" in "de" is replaced with the day of the month.
	
	::Cause::
	  The format-string parsing logic works by walking through the
	  format string character-by-character. So when it gets to the "d"
	  in "de", it has no way of discerning that it is not the "d"
	  formatting instruction but is instead part of a word intended to
	  be included in the output as a literal string.
	
	::Fix::
	  The format-string parsing logic now splits format strings into
	  tokens and delimiters and evaluates them token-by-token instead
	  of character-by-character.
	
	  For example, it splits the Spanish "long" date format like this:
	
	    <token>d</token> <token>de</token> <token>B</token> ...
	
	  Thus, in looking for the "d" formatting instruction, the "d"
	  token matches but the "de" token does not.
	
	  As delimiters, it recognizes the following characters:
	
	    <space> <tab> <CR> <LF> , . / - ( ) [ ]
	
	::Affects:
	  This change affects output of the "dbtimestamp" PI as well as
	  output from any customization layers that call the
	  "datetime.format" template. It affect all formats (HTML, FO, etc.).

	which lacks Code)

	* common.xsl: Fixed typo.

2005-05-10  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* common.xsl: Strip whitespace in Manvolnum; closes bug #959805
	(thanks to Jens Elkner for reporting the problem)
	
	::PROBLEM:
	  Whitespace is preserved in output for Manvolnum. Among other
	  things, this results in garbled filenames for man pages
	  generated from the manpages stylesheets.
	
	::CAUSE
	  Manvolnum was not included in the master list of "strip space"
	  elements.
	
	::FIX

	* common.xsl: Added template to uppercase strings (closes #1199123)
	
	Given a string, this template does a language-aware conversion of
	that string to all uppercase letters, based on the values of the
	lowercase.alpha and uppercase.alpha gentext keys for the current
	locale. It affects only those characters found in the values of
	lowercase.alpha and uppercase.alpha. All other characters are left
	unchanged.

	value, with xhtml falling back to html if needed.

2002-12-17  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* common.xsl: Changed selection of mediaobject to be more consistent using

	title.markup mode and label.markup mode, and made
	the error message conditional on that parameter.  The
	default value is 1, so the message will still be

	stylesheet sets verbose to 0 when trolling for
	cross reference targets to eliminate useless noise
	on elements that have an id attribute but no title or label.

	using simpler logic.  Added params for the content

	where the content is supplied from a data file.

2002-03-14  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* common.xsl: Handle revisionflag a little better on copyrights

	* common.xsl, gentext.xsl, l10n.xsl, labels.xsl, subtitles.xsl, table.xsl, titles.xsl:

	* common.xsl, gentext.xsl, l10n.xsl, labels.xsl, subtitles.xsl, table.xsl, titles.xsl: 
	Whitespace changes only: use PC-style CR/LF because Unix clients choke on this far less often than PC clients choke on the reverse. Grrr.

2002-03-07  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>

	* titles.xsl: refentry title in title.markup mode now follows $allow-anchors setting
	to prevent index entries from appearing in the TOC.

	because that is the correct code.

	* l10n.xsl: Added code to the "l10n.language" template to fall
	back to the two-letter lang code if a longer lang
	does not have a <lang>.xml localization file.
	And it falls back to the default lang if it can't
	find that either.
	
	Also fixed a bug for finding the lang attribute.
	It was using the last() function, but in an
	ancestor-or-self node set you want the first ancestor
	(closest) with a lang value.
	
	49c49
	<                                |ancestor-or-self::*/@xml:lang)[last()]"/>
