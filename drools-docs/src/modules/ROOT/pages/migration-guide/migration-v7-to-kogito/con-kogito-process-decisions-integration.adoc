= Integration of process and decision microservices in {KOGITO}

[role="_abstract"]
When designing a business process in {KOGITO}, you can use DMN and DRL to define the decisions as distinct microservices. In {KOGITO}, you can use the following methods to integrate the processes and decisions:

* *Embedded method*: Enables you to integrate process and decision microservices using business rule tasks.
* *Remote method*: Enables you to integrate process and decision microservices using REST endpoints.

Depending on the use case, you can use either the embedded method or the remote method, or you can combine both methods in a single process.
