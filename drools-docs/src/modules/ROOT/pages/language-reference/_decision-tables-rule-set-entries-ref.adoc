[id='decision-tables-rule-set-entries-ref']
= RuleSet definitions

Entries in the `RuleSet` area of a decision table define DRL constructs and rule attributes that you want to apply to all rules in a package (not only in the spreadsheet). Entries must be in a vertically stacked sequence of cell pairs, where the first cell contains a label and the cell to the right contains the value. A decision table spreadsheet can have only one `RuleSet` area.

The following table lists the supported labels and values for `RuleSet` definitions:

.Supported `RuleSet` definitions
[cols="30%,40%,30%", options="header"]
|===
|Label |Value |Usage

|`RuleSet`
|The package name for the generated DRL file. Optional, the default is `rule_table`.
|Must be the first entry.

|`Sequential`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then salience is used to ensure that rules fire from the top down.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, no firing order is imposed.

|`SequentialMaxPriority`
|Integer numeric value
|Optional, at most once. In sequential mode, this option is used to set the start value of the salience. If omitted, the default value is 65535.

|`SequentialMinPriority`
|Integer numeric value
|Optional, at most once. In sequential mode, this option is used to check if this minimum salience value is not violated. If omitted, the default value is 0.

|`EscapeQuotes`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then quotation marks are escaped so that they appear literally in the DRL.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, quotation marks are escaped.

|`NumericDisabled`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then a String representation is used for DRL instead of a double value
from a Numeric cell. It would also skip additional numeric processing for the double value. For example, date formatting based on {PRODUCT} system property.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, a double value is used.

|`IgnoreNumericFormat`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then the format for numeric values is ignored, for example, percent and currency.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, DRL takes formatted values.

|`Import`
|A comma-separated list of Java classes to import from another package.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Variables`
|Declarations of DRL globals (a type followed by a variable name). Multiple global definitions must be separated by commas.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Functions`
|One or more function definitions, according to DRL syntax.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Queries`
|One or more query definitions, according to DRL syntax.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Declare`
|One or more declarative types, according to DRL syntax.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Unit`
|The rule units that the rules generated from this decision table belong to.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, the rules do not belong to any unit.

|`Dialect`
|`java` or `mvel`. The dialect used in the actions of the decision table.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, `java` is imposed.

WARNING: In some cases, Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, and OpenOffice might encode a double quotation mark differently, causing a compilation error. For example, `"`A`"` will fail, but `"A"` will pass.
