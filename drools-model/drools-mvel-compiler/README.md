Rules of the game
=========

Every functionality goes in a different phase
Try to avoid ifs (transform data instead)
Subtype every different data tpye



// phases
// find first child / Create a structure where there's the first child and all the others this phase can also be removed
// create type information for all structure
// transform
// discard and take only the last expression (or the first?)

// Other possibile phases (skippable on RHS)
// used declaration phase
// react on phase
// initializire (from expression)
