  <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">Name:</emphasis> Number Guess 
<emphasis role="bold">Main class:</emphasis> org.drools.examples.numberguess.NumberGuessExample
<emphasis role="bold">Type:</emphasis> Java application
<emphasis role="bold">Rules file:</emphasis> NumberGuess.drl
<emphasis role="bold">Objective:</emphasis> Demonstrate use of Rule Flow to organise Rules
</programlisting>

  <para>The "Number Guess" example shows the use of Rule Flow, a way of
  controlling the order in which rules are fired. It uses widely
  understood workflow diagrams for defining the order in which groups
  of rules will be executed.</para>

  <example>
    <title>Creating the Number Guess RuleBase: NumberGuessExample.main() - part 1</title>

        <programlisting language="java">final KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource( "NumberGuess.drl",
                                                    ShoppingExample.class ),
              ResourceType.DRL );
kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource( "NumberGuess.rf",
                                                    ShoppingExample.class ),
              ResourceType.DRF );

final KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase();
kbase.addKnowledgePackages( kbuilder.getKnowledgePackages() );</programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>The creation of the package and the loading of the rules (using
  the <code>add()</code> method) is the same as the previous examples.
  There is an additional line to add the Rule Flow
  (<filename>NumberGuess.rf</filename>), which provides the option of
  specifying different rule flows for the same Knowledge Base.
  Otherwise, the Knowledge Base is created in the same manner as before.</para>

  <example>
    <title>Starting the RuleFlow: NumberGuessExample.main() - part 2</title>

    <programlisting language="java">final StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatefulKnowledgeSession();

KnowledgeRuntimeLogger logger =
  KnowledgeRuntimeLoggerFactory.newFileLogger(ksession, "log/numberguess");

ksession.insert( new GameRules( 100, 5 ) );
ksession.insert( new RandomNumber() );
ksession.insert( new Game() );

ksession.startProcess( "Number Guess" );
ksession.fireAllRules();

logger.close();

ksession.dispose();</programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>Once we have a Knowledge Base, we can use it to obtain a Stateful
  Session. Into our session we insert our facts, i.e., standard Java objects.
  (For simplicity, in this sample, these classes are all contained within
  our <filename>NumberGuessExample.java</filename> file. Class
  <code>GameRules</code> provides the maximum range and the number of guesses
  allowed. Class <code>RandomNumber</code> automatically generates a number
  between 0 and 100 and makes it available to our rules, by insertion via
  the <code>getValue()</code> method. Class <code>Game</code> keeps track
  of the guesses we have made before, and their number.</para>

  <para>Note that before we call the standard <code>fireAllRules()</code>
  method, we also start the process that we loaded earlier, via the
  <code>startProcess()</code> method. We'll learn where to obtain the
  parameter we pass ("Number Guess", i.e., the identifier of the rule flow)
  when we talk about the rule flow file and the graphical Rule Flow Editor
  below.</para>

  <para>Before we finish the discussion of our Java code, we note that in
  some real-life application we would examine the final state of the objects.
  (Here, we could retrieve the number of guesses, to add it to a high score
  table.) For this example we are content to ensure that the Working Memory
  session is cleared by calling the <code>dispose()</code> method.</para>

  <para>If you open the <filename>NumberGuess.rf</filename> file in the
  Drools IDE (provided you have the JBoss Rules extensions installed
  correctly in Eclipse) you should see the above diagram, similar to a
  standard flowchart. Its icons are similar (but not exactly the same)
  as in the JBoss jBPM workflow product. Should you wish to edit the
  diagram, a menu of available components should be available to the
  left of the diagram in the IDE, which is called the
  <emphasis>palette</emphasis>. This diagram is saved in XML, an
  (almost) human readable format, using XStream.</para>

  <para>If it is not already open, ensure that the Properties View is
  visible in the IDE. It can be opened by clicking "Window", then
  "Show View" and "Other", where you can select the "Properties" view.
  If you do this <emphasis>before</emphasis> you select any item on
  the rule flow (or click on the blank space in the rule flow) you
  should be presented with the following set of properties.</para>

  <figure>
    <title>Properties for the Number Guess Rule Flow</title>

      <imageobject>
        <imagedata width="100%"

      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
  </figure>

  <para>Keep an eye on the Properties View as we progress through the
  example's rule flow, as it presents valuable information. In this case, it
  provides us with the identification of the Rule Flow Process that
  we used in our earlier code snippet, when we called
  <code>session.startProcess()</code>.</para>

  <para>In the "Number Guess" Rule Flow we encounter several node
  types, many of them identified by an icon.</para>

  <para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Start node (white arrow in a green circle) and the End
        node (red box) mark beginning and end of the rule flow.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A Rule Flow Group box (yellow, without an icon) represents
        a Rule Flow Groups defined in our rules (DRL) file that we will
        look at later. For example, when the flow reaches the Rule Flow Group
        "Too High", only those rules marked with an attribute of
        <literal>ruleflow-group</literal> <code>"Too High"</code> can potentially fire.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Action nodes (yellow, cog-shaped icon) perform standard Java
        method calls. Most action nodes in this example call
        <code>System.out.println()</code>, indicating the program's progress
        to the user.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Split and Join Nodes (blue ovals, no icon) such as "Guess Correct?"
        and "More guesses Join" mark places where the flow of control can
        split, according to various conditions, and rejoin, respectively</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>Arrows indicate the flow between the various nodes.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>The various nodes in combination with the rules make the
  Number Guess game work. For example, the "Guess" Rule Flow Group
  allows only the rule "Get user Guess" to fire, because only that rule
  has a matching attribute of <literal>ruleflow-group</literal> <code>"Guess"</code>.</para>

  <example>
    <title>A Rule firing only at a specific point in the Rule Flow:
    NumberGuess.drl</title>

        <programlisting>rule "Get user Guess"
    ruleflow-group "Guess"
    no-loop
    when
        $r : RandomNumber()
        rules : GameRules( allowed : allowedGuesses )
        game : Game( guessCount &lt; allowed )
        not ( Guess() )
    then
        System.out.println( "You have " + ( rules.allowedGuesses - game.guessCount )
                            + " out of " + rules.allowedGuesses
                            + " guesses left.\nPlease enter your guess from 0 to "
                            + rules.maxRange );
        br = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader( System.in ) );
        i = br.readLine();        
        modify ( game ) { guessCount = game.guessCount + 1 }
        insert( new Guess( i ) );
end</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The rest of this rule is fairly standard. The LHS section
      (after <literal>when</literal>) of the rule states that it will be activated
      for each <code>RandomNumber</code> object inserted into the Working
      Memory where <code>guessCount</code> is less than
      <code>allowedGuesses</code> from the <code>GameRules</code> object
      and where the user has not guessed the correct number.</para>

      <para>The RHS section (or consequence, after <literal>then</literal>) prints a
      message to the user and then awaits user input from
      <code>System.in</code>. After obtaining this input (the
      <code>readLine()</code> method call blocks until the return key is
      pressed) it modifies the guess count and inserts the new
      guess, making both available to the Working Memory.</para>

      <para>The rest of the rules file is fairly standard: the package
      declares the dialect as MVEL, and various Java classes are imported.
      In total, there are five rules in this file:</para>

      <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Get User Guess, the Rule we examined above.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A Rule to record the highest guess.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A Rule to record the lowest guess.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A Rule to inspect the guess and retract it from memory if
            incorrect.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A Rule that notifies the user that all guesses have been
            used up.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

  <para>One point of integration between the standard Rules and
      the RuleFlow is via the <literal>ruleflow-group</literal> attribute on the
      rules, as dicussed above. A
      <emphasis>second point of integration between the rules (.drl) file
      and the Rules Flow .rf files</emphasis> is
      that the Split Nodes (the blue ovals) can use values in the Working Memory
      (as updated by the rules) to decide which flow of action to take. To see
      how this works, click on the "Guess Correct Node"; then within the
      Properties View, open the Constraints Editor by clicking the button at
      the right that appears once you click on the "Constraints" property line.
      You should see something similar to the diagram below.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Edit Constraints for the "Guess Correct" Node</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Examples/NumberGuessExample/numberguess-editconstraints.png" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Click on the "Edit" button beside "To node Too High" and you'll
      see a dialog  like the one below. The values in the "Textual Editor"
      window follow the standard rule format for the LHS and can refer to
      objects in Working Memory.
      The consequence (RHS) is that the flow of control follows this node
      (i.e., "To node Too High") if the LHS expression evaluates to true.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Since the file <filename>NumberGuess.java</filename> contains a
      <code>main()</code> method, it
      can be run as a standard Java application, either from the command line
      or via the IDE. A typical game might result in the interaction below.
      The numbers in bold are typed in by the user.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Example Console output where the Number Guess Example beat the
        human!</title>

        <programlisting>You have 5 out of 5 guesses left.

      <para>A summary of what is happening in this sample is:</para>


        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The <code>main()</code> method of
            <filename>NumberGuessExample.java</filename> loads a Rule Base,
            creates a Stateful Session and inserts <code>Game</code>,
            <code>GameRules</code> and <code>RandomNumber</code>
            (containing the target number) objects into it. The
            method also sets the process flow we are going to use, and fires all
            rules. Control passes to the Rule Flow.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>File <filename>NumberGuess.rf</filename>, the Rule Flow,

          <listitem>
            <para>At the Guess node, the appropriate Rule Flow Group
            ("Get user Guess") is enabled. In this case the Rule "Guess" (in the
            <filename>NumberGuess.drl</filename> file) is triggered. This rule 
            displays a message to the user, takes the response, and puts it into
            Working Memory. Flow passes to the next Rule Flow Node.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>At the next node, "Guess Correct", constraints inspect the

            <para>If the guess in step 4 was too high or too low, flow proceeds
            along a path which has an action node with normal Java code
            printing a suitable message and a Rule Flow Group causing a
            highest guess or lowest guess rule to be triggered. Flow passes
            from these nodes to step 6.</para>

            <para>If the guess in step 4 was right, we proceed along the path
            towards the end of the Rule Flow. Before we get there, an action
            node with normal Java code prints a statement "you guessed
            correctly". There is a join node here (just before the Rule Flow
            end) so that our no-more-guesses path (step 7) can also terminate
            the Rule Flow.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>The "More guesses" decision node (on the right hand side of the

            guesses and if so, goto step 3. If not, we proceed to the end of
