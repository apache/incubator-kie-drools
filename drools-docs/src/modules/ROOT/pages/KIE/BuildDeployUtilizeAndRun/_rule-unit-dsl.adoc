= Rule Unit DSL

In addition to the standard Rule Unit API, {PRODUCT} offers an alternative way of writing rules in combination with Rule Unit.
You can now define the rules for Rule Units using a dedicated set of Java APIs.

TIP: As an end-user, you can think of the Rule Unit DSL as an alternative to DRL, in order to define your rules with an internal DSL using Java.
This can be helpful if you are authoring rules as a {PRODUCT} end-user, but you are also proficient with Java:
in that case, you now can define rules with DRL or Rule Unit DSL.

CAUTION: The Rule Unit DSL is _not_ intended to be used a way to code-generate executable model code, nor to produce DRL files.
The goal of the Rule Unit DSL is to programmatically invoke the exec model methods (at runtime).
As a developer using {PRODUCT} for your application development
(you do not write the rules yourself, you write the Java code to integrate {PRODUCT} in your app development for your end-users)
you may find helpful to leverage _programmatically_ the Rule Unit DSL _only_ for very dynamic use-cases,
that is when the rule is only known at runtime, and compile-time performance optimizations are not needed.

Let's learn with comments on the example.

[source,java]
----
public class HelloWorldUnit implements RuleUnitDefinition {

    private final DataStore<String> strings; // DataStore where you add String fact
    private final DataStore<Integer> ints; // DataStore where you add Integer fact
    private final List<String> results = new ArrayList<>(); // Store results. In traditional DRL, it is called `global`

    // omitting constructors and getters
    // ...

    @Override
    public void defineRules(RulesFactory rulesFactory) {
        // /strings[ this == "Hello World" ]
        rulesFactory.rule()
                    .on(strings)
                    .filter(EQUAL, "Hello World") // when no extractor is provided "this" is implicit
                    .execute(results, r -> r.add("it worked!")); // the consequence can ignore the matched facts

        // /strings[ length > 5 ]
        rulesFactory.rule()
                    .on(strings) // since the datasource has been already initialized its class can be inferred without the need of explicitly passing it
                    .filter(s -> s.length(), GREATER_THAN, 5) // when no property name is provided it's impossible to generate indexes and property reactivity
                    .execute(results, (r, s) -> r.add("it also worked with " + s.toUpperCase())); // this consequence also uses the matched fact

        // /strings[ length < 5 ]
        rulesFactory.rule("MyRule") // it is possible to optionally set a name for the rule
                    .on(strings)
                    .filter("length", s -> s.length(), LESS_THAN, 5) // providing the name of the property used in the constraint allows index and property reactivity generation
                    .execute(results, r -> r.add("this shouldn't fire"));

        // $s: /strings[ length > 5 ]
        // /ints[ this > 5, this == $s.length ]
        rulesFactory.rule()
                    .on(strings)
                    .filter("length", s -> s.length() > 5) // it is also possible to use a plain lambda predicate, but in this case no index can be generated
                    .join(
                          rule -> rule.on(ints) // creates a new pattern ...
                                      .filter(GREATER_THAN, 5) // ... add an alpha filter to it
                    ) // ... and join it with the former one
                    .filter(EQUAL, String::length) // this filter is applied to the result of the join, so it is a beta constraint
                    .execute(results, (r, s, i) -> r.add("String '" + s + "' is " + i + " characters long")); // the consequence captures all the joined variables positionally
    }
}

As you define rules using `defineRules` method, you can execute the rules, of course, without having to define them using DRL.

[source,java]
----
    public void helloWorld() {
        HelloWorldUnit unit = new HelloWorldUnit();
        unit.getStrings().add("Hello World");

        RuleUnitInstance<HelloWorldUnit> unitInstance = RuleUnitProvider.get().createRuleUnitInstance(unit);

        assertThat(unitInstance.fire()).isEqualTo(2);
        assertThat(unit.getResults()).containsExactlyInAnyOrder("it worked!", "it also worked with HELLO WORLD");

        unit.getResults().clear();
        unit.getInts().add(11);
        assertThat(unitInstance.fire()).isEqualTo(1);
        assertThat(unit.getResults()).containsExactly("String 'Hello World' is 11 characters long");

        unitInstance.close();
    }
