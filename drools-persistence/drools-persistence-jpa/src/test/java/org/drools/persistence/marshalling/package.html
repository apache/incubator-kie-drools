  <p>
  This package contains utility classes and test to test serialization/marshalling in Drools and jBPM. 
  </p><p>
  It's far easier to test marshalling in the drools-persistence-jpa (and the jbpm-persistence-jpa) modules 
  because we can easily create and insert proxies for EntityManagerFactory and EntityManager instances here.
  </p><p>
  In the drools-core (or jbpm-flow) modules, it's very hard to insert a proxy into the chain of objects
  responsible for marshalling and unmarshalling and other serialization functionality.
