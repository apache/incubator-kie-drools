  <title>Rules and Processes</title>
  <para>Drools Flow is a workflow and process engine that allows
  advanced integration of processes and rules.  This chapter gives an
  overview of how to integrate rules and processes, ranging from simple
  to advanced.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Why use rules in processes?</title>
    <para>
      Workflow languages that depend purely on process constructs (like nodes and connections) to describe
      the business logic of (a part of) an application tend to be quite complex.  While these workflow
      constructs are very well suited to describe the overall control flow of an application, it can be
      very difficult to describe complex logic and exceptional situations.  Therefore, executable processes
      tend to become very complex.  We believe that, by extending a process engine with support for declarative
      rules in combination with these regular process constructs, this complexity can be kept under control. 
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Simplicity: Complex decisions are usually easier to specify using a set of rules.  Rules can
          describe complex business logic more easily by using an advanced constraint language.  Multiple
          rules can be combined, each describing a part of the business logic.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Agility: Rules and processes can have a separate life cycle.  This means that for example
          we can change the rules describing some crucial decision points without having to change the process
          itself.  Rules can be added, removed or modified to fine-tune the behaviour of the process to the
          constantly evolving requirements and environment.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Different scope: Rules can be reused accross processes or outside processes.  Therefore, your
          business logic is not locked inside your processes.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Declarative: Focus on describing 'what' instead of 'how'.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Granularity: It is easy to write simple rules that handle specific circumstances.  Processes
          more suited to describe the overall control flow but tend to become very complex if they also need
          to describe a lot of exceptional situations.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Data-centric: Rules can easily handle large data sets.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Performance: Rule evaluation is optimized.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Advanced condition and action language: Rule languages supports advanced features like custom
          functions, collections, not, exists, for all, etc.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Higher-level: Using DSLs, business editors, decision tables, decision trees, etc. your business
          logic could be described in a way that can be understood (and possibly even modified) by business users.</para>

    <title>Why integrate rules and processes in a single engine?</title>
    <para>
      Drools Flow combines a process and a rules engine in one software product.  This offers several advantages
      (compared to trying to loosely coupling an existing process and rules product):
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Simplicity: Easier for end user to combine both rules and processes.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Encapsulation: Sometimes close integration between processes and rules is beneficial.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Performance: No unnecessary passing, transformation or synchronization of data</para>

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Manageability: Easier to manage one product, rules and processes can be similar artefacts in a larger knowledge repository.</para>

    <title>Approach</title>
    <para>
    Workflow languages describe the order in which activities should be performed using a flow chart.
    A process engine is responsible for selecting which activities should be executed based on the current
    state of the executing processes.
    Rules on the other hand are composed of a set of conditions that describe when a rule is applicable
    and an action that is executed when the rule is applicable.  The rules engine is then responsible for
    evaluating and executing the rules.  It decides which rules need to be executed based on the current
    state of the application.
    </para>

    <para>
    Workflow processes are very good at describing the overall control flow of (possibly long-running)
    applications.  However, processes that are used to define complex business decisions or contain a lot
    of exceptional situations or need to respond to various external events tend to become very complex.
    Rules on the other hand are very good at describing complex decisions and reasoning about large amounts
    of data or events.  It is however not trivial to define long-running processes using rules.
    </para>

    <para>
    In the past, users were forced to choose between defining their business logic using either a process
    or rules engine.  Problems that required complex reasoning about large amounts of data used a rules engine,
    while users that wanted to focus on describing the control flow of their processes were forced to use a
    process engine. However, businesses nowadays might want to combine both processes and rules in order to
    be able to define all their business logic in the format that best suits their needs.
    </para>

    <para>
    Basically, both a rules and a process engine will derive the next steps that need to be executed by
    looking at its knowledge base (a set of rules or processes respectively) and the current known state
    of the application (the data in the working memory or the state of the executing process instances
    respectively).  If we want to integrate rules and processes, we need an engine that can decide the next
    steps taking into account the logic that is defined inside both the processes and the rules.
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>Teaching a rules engine about processes</title>
      <para>
      It is very difficult (and probably very inefficient as well) to extend a process engine to also take
      rules into account: the process engine would need to check for rules that might need to be executed
      at every step and would have to keep the data that is used by the rules engine up to date.  However,
      it is not that difficult to 'teach' a rules engine about processes.  If the current state of the processes
      is also inserted as part of the data the rules engine reasons about, and we 'learn' the rules engine how
      to derive the next steps of an executing process, the rules engine will then be able to derive the next steps
      taking both rules and processes into account.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Inversion of control</title>
      <para>
      From the process perspective, this means that there is an inversion of control.  In a normal
      proces engine, the engine is in full control and derives the next steps based on the current state of the
      process instance.  If needed, it can contact external services to retrieve additional information (e.g. invoke
      a rules engine to request a decision), but it solely decides which steps to take, and is responsible for executing
      these steps.
      </para>

      <para>
      However, only our extended rules engine (that can reason about both rules and processes) is capable of deriving the next
      steps taking both rules and processes into account.  If a part of the process needs to be executed, the rules engine
      will request the process engine to execute this step.  Once this step has been performed, the process engine returns
      control to the rules engine to again derive the next steps.  This means that the control on what to do next has been
      inverted: the process engine itself no longer decides the next step to take but our extended rules engine will be in
      control, notifying the process engine when to execute the next step.

    <title>Example</title>
    <para>
    The drools-examples project contains a sample process (org.drools.examples.process.order)
    that illustrates some of the advantages of being able to combine processes and rules.  This
    process describes an order application where incoming orders are validated, possible discount
    are calculated and shipping of the goods is requested.

    <section>
      <title>Evaluating a set of rules in your process</title>
      <para>Drools Flow can easily include a set of rules as part of the process.
      The rules that need to be evaluated should be grouped in a ruleflow
      group (using the ruleflow-group rule attribute) and a RuleSet node
      can be used to trigger the evaluation of these rules in your process.  This example
      uses two RuleSet nodes in the process: one for the validation of the order
      and one for calculating the discount.  For example, one of the rules for validiting
      an order looks like this (note the ruleflow-group attribute, which makes sure that
      this rule is evaluated as part of the RuleSet node with the same ruleflow-group):</para>

    <section>
      <title>Using rules for evaluating constraints</title>
	<para>Rules can be used for expressing and evaluating complex constraints
      in your process.  For example, when a decision should be made which execution
      paths should be selected at a split, rules could be used to define these
      conditions.  Similarly, a wait state could use a rule to define how long
      to wait.  This example uses rules for deciding the next action after validating
      the order.  If the order contains errors, a sales representative should try to
      correct the order.  Orders with a value &gt; 1000$ are more important and a senior
      sales representative should follow up the order. All other orders should just
      proceed normally.  An decision node is used to select one of these alternatives,
      and rules are used to describe the constraints for each of them:</para>

      <title>Assignment rules</title>
	<para>Human tasks can be used in a process to describe work that needs to
      be executed by a human actor.  Which actor could be based on the current
      state of the process, and the history.  Assignment rules can be used to
	describe how to the actor based on this information.  These assignment rules
      will then be applied automatically whenever a new human task needs to be
      executed.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Describing exceptional situations using rules</title>
	<para>Rules can be used for describing exceptional situations and how to respond
      to these situations.  Adding all this information in the control flow of the main
      process would make the basic process much more complex.  Rules can be used to
      handle each of these situations separately, without making the core process more
      complex.  It also makes it much easier to adapt existing processes to take new
      unanticipated events into account.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Modularizing concerns using rules</title>
      <para>The process defines the overall control flow.  Rules could be used
      to add additional concerns to this process without making the overall control
      flow more complex.  For example, rules could be defined to log certain information
      during the execution of the process.  The original process is not altered and
      all logging functionality is cleanly modularized as a set of rules.  This
      greatly improves reusability (allows users to easily apply the same strategy
      on different processes), readability (control flow of the original process
      is still the same) and modifiability (you can easily add, remove or change the
      logging strategy by adding, removing or changing the rules, the process should not
      be modified).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Using rules to dynamically alter the behaviour of the process</title>
      <para>Rules can be used to dynamically fine-tune the behaviour of your processes.
      For example, if a problem is encountered at runtime with one of the processes, new rules
      could be added at runtime to log additional information or handle
      specific cases of the process.  Once the problem is solved or the circumstances have
      changed, these rules can easily be removed again.  Based on
      the current status, different strategies could be selected dynamically.
      For example, based on the current load of all the services, rules could be used
      to optimize the process to the current load.  This process contains a simple example
      that allows you to dynamically add or remove logging for the 'Check Order' task.  When the
      'Debugging output' checkbox in the main application window is checked, a rule is dynamically
      loaded to add a logging statement to the console whenever the 'Check Order' task is requested.
      Unchecking the box will dynamically remove the rule again.

      <title>Integrated tooling</title>
      <para>Processes and rules are integrated in the Drools Eclipse IDE.  Both processes and rules
      are simply considered as different types of business logic, but are managed almost identical.
      For example, loading a process or a set of rules into the engine is very similar:</para>

    </mediaobject>

      <para>Our audit log also contains an integrated view, showing how rules and processes are influencing
      each other.  For example, a part of the log shows how the '5% discount' rule is executed as part of the
      'Calculate Discount' node.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Domain-specific rules and processes</title>
      <para>Rules do not need to be defined using the core rule language syntax, but they also can be defined
      using our more advanced rule editors like domain-specific languages, decision tables, guided editors, etc.
      Our examples defines a domain-specific language for describing assignment rules, based on the type of
      task, its properties, the process it is defined in, etc.  This makes the assignment rules much more
      understandable for non-experts.</para>
