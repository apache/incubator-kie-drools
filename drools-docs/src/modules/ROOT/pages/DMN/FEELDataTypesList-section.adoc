= Lists

Lists in FEEL are represented by a comma separated list of values enclosed in square brackets. For instance:
```
[ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

All lists in FEEL are homogeneous (that is, all elements in a list are of the same type) and immutable. Elements in a list
can be accessed by index, where the first element is 1. Negative indexes can be used to access elements starting from the
end of the list, so -1 is the last element. For instance, the following expression returns the second element of a list x:

```
x[2]
```

The following expression returns the second to last element:

```
x[-2]
```

WARNING: The DMN specification does not allow a variable to be defined as a generic list type. Drools extends the
specification to support that.
