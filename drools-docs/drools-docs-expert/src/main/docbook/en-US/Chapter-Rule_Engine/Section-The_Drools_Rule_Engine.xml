  <title>The Drools Rule Engine</title>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Drools is split into two main parts: Authoring and Runtime.</para>

    <para>The authoring process involves the creation of DRL or XML files for
    rules which are fed into a parser - defined by an Antlr 3 grammar. The
    parser checks for correctly formed grammar and produces an intermediate
    structure for the "descr"; where the "descr" indicates the AST that
    "describes" the rules. The AST is then passed to the Package Builder which
    produces Packages. Package Builder also undertakes any code generation and
    compilation that is necessary for the creation of the Package. A Package
    object is self contained and deployable, in that it's a serialized object
    consisting of one or more rules.</para>

    <para>A RuleBase is a runtime component which consists of one or more
    Packages. Packages can be added and removed from the RuleBase at any time.
    A RuleBase can instantiate one or more WorkingMemories at any time; a weak
    reference is maintained, unless configured otherwise. The Working Memory
    consists of a number of sub components, including Working Memory Event
    Support, Truth Maintenance System, Agenda and Agenda Event Support. Object
    insertion may result in the creation of one or more Activations. The
    Agenda is responsible for scheduling the execution of these
    Activations.</para>

    <para>Four classes are used for authoring: <code>DrlParser</code>, <code>XmlParser</code>,
    <code>ProcessBuilder</code> and <code>PackageBuilder</code>. The two parser classes produce "descr"
    (description) AST models from a provided Reader instance. ProcessBuilder
    reads in an xstream serialization representation of the Rule Flow.
    PackageBuilder provides convienience APIs so that you can mostly forget
    about those classes. The three convenience methods are
    <code>addPackageFromDrl</code>, <code>addPackageFromXml</code> and <code>addRuleFlow</code> - all take an
    instance of Reader as an argument. The example below shows how to build a
    package that includes both XML and DRL rule files and a ruleflow file,
    which are in the classpath. Note that all added package sources must be of
    the same package namespace for the current <code>PackageBuilder</code> instance!</para>

    <example>
      <title>Building a Package from Multiple Sources</title>

      <programlisting>PackageBuilder builder = new PackageBuilder();
builder.addPackageFromDrl( new InputStreamReader( getClass().getResourceAsStream( "package1.drl" ) ) );
builder.addPackageFromXml( new InputStreamReader( getClass().getResourceAsStream( "package2.xml" ) ) );
builder.addRuleFlow( new InputStreamReader( getClass().getResourceAsStream( "ruleflow.rfm" ) ) );
Package pkg = builder.getPackage();      </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>It is essential that you always check your PackageBuilder for errors
    before attempting to use it. While the ruleBase does throw an
    InvalidRulePackage when a broken Package is added, the detailed error
    information is stripped and only a toString() equivalent is available. If
    you interrogate the PackageBuilder itself much more information is
    available.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Checking the PackageBuilder for errors</title>

      <programlisting>PackageBuilder builder = new PackageBuilder();
builder.addPackageFromDrl( new InputStreamReader( getClass().getResourceAsStream( "package1.drl" ) ) );
PackageBuilderErrors errors = builder.getErrors();</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>PackageBuilder is configurable using PackageBuilderConfiguration
    class.</para>

    <figure>
      <title>PackageBuilderConfiguration</title>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>It has default values that can be overridden programmatically via
    setters or on first use via property settings. At the heart of the
    settings is the <code>ChainedProperties</code> class which searches a number of
    locations looking for <code>drools.packagebuilder.conf</code> files; as it finds them
    it adds the properties to the master propperties list; this provides a
    level precedence. In order of precedence those locations are: System
    Properties, user defined file in System Properties, user home directory,
    working directory, various <code>META-INF</code> locations. Further to this the
    <code>droosl-compiler</code> jar has the default settings in its <code>META-INF</code>
    directory.</para>

    <para>Currently the <code>PackageBuilderConfiguration</code> handles the registry of
    Accumulate functions, registry of Dialects and the main
    ClassLoader.</para>

    <para>Drools has a pluggable Dialect system, which allows other languages
    to compile and execution expressions and blocks, the two currently
    supported dialects are Java and MVEL. Each has its own
    <code>DialectConfiguration</code> Implementation; the javadocs provide details for each
    setter/getter and the property names used to configure them.</para>

    <figure>
      <title><code>JavaDialectConfiguration</code></title>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The <code>JavaDialectConfiguration</code> allows the compiler and language levels
    to be supported. You can override by setting the
    <code>drools.dialect.java.compiler</code> property in a <code>packagebuilder.conf</code> file that
    the <code>ChainedProperties</code> instance will find, or you can do it at runtime as
    shown below.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Configuring the <code>JavaDialectConfiguration</code> to use JANINO via a
      setter</title>

      <programlisting>PackageBuilderConfiguration cfg = new PackageBuilderConfiguration( );
JavaDialectConfiguration javaConf = (JavaDialectConfiguration) cfg.getDialectConfiguration( "java" );
javaConf.setCompiler( JavaDialectConfiguration.JANINO );            </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>if you do not have Eclipse JDT Core in your classpath you must
    override the compiler setting before you instantiate this <code>PackageBuilder</code>,
    you can either do that with a <code>packagebuilder</code> properties file the
    <code>ChainedProperties</code> class will find, or you can do it programmatically as
    shown below; note this time I use properties to inject the value for
    startup.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Configuring the <code>JavaDialectConfiguration</code> to use JANINO</title>

      <programlisting>Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty( "drools.dialect.java.compiler",
                        "JANINO" );
PackageBuilderConfiguration cfg = new PackageBuilderConfiguration( properties );
JavaDialectConfiguration javaConf = (JavaDialectConfiguration) cfg.getDialectConfiguration( "java" );
assertEquals( JavaDialectConfiguration.JANINO,
              javaConf.getCompiler() ); // demonstrate that the compiler is correctly configured            </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Currently it allows alternative compilers (Janino, Eclipse JDT) to
    be specified, different JDK source levels ("1.4" and "1.5") and a parent
    class loader. The default compiler is Eclipse JDT Core at source level
    "1.4" with the parent class loader set to
    <code>Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()</code>.</para>

    <para>The following show how to specify the JANINO compiler
    programmatically:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Configuring the <code>PackageBuilder</code> to use JANINO via a
      property</title>

      <programlisting>PackageBuilderConfiguration conf = new PackageBuilderConfiguration();
conf.setCompiler( PackageBuilderConfiguration.JANINO );
PackageBuilder builder = new PackageBuilder( conf );</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The <code>MVELDialectConfiguration</code> is much simpler and only allows strict
    mode to be turned on and off, by default strict is true; this means all
    method calls must be type safe either by inference or by explicit
    typing.</para>

    </figure>

    <para>A <code>RuleBase</code> is instantiated using the <code>RuleBaseFactory</code>, by default
    this returns a ReteOO <code>RuleBase</code>. Packages are added, in turn, using the
    <code>addPackage</code> method. You may specify packages of any namespace and multiple
    packages of the same namespace may be added.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding a Package to a new RuleBase</title>

      <programlisting>RuleBase ruleBase  = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase();
ruleBase.addPackage( pkg  );        </programlisting>
    </example>

    <figure>
      <title>RuleBase</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
		<imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Rule_Engine/RuleBase.png" format="PNG" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>A <code>RuleBase</code> contains one or more more packages of rules, ready to be
    used, i.e., they have been validated/compiled etc. A <code>RuleBase</code> is
    serializable so it can be deployed to JNDI or other such services.
    Typically, a rulebase would be generated and cached on first use; to save
    on the continually re-generation of the <code>RuleBase</code>; which is
    expensive.</para>

    <para>A <code>RuleBase</code> instance is thread safe, in the sense that you can have
    the one instance shared across threads in your application, which may be a
    web application, for instance. The most common operation on a rulebase is
    to create a new rule session; either stateful or stateless.</para>

    <para>The <code>RuleBase</code> also holds references to any stateful session that it
    has spawned, so that if rules are changing (or being added/removed etc.
    for long running sessions), they can be updated with the latest rules
    (without necessarily having to restart the session). You can specify not
    to maintain a reference, but only do so if you know the <code>RuleBase</code> will not
    be updated. References are not stored for stateless sessions.</para>

    <programlisting>ruleBase.newStatefulSession();  // maintains a reference.
ruleBase.newStatefulSession( false ); // do not maintain a reference    </programlisting>

    <para>Packages can be added and removed at any time - all changes will be
    propagated to the existing stateful sessions; don't forget to call
    <code>fireAllRules()</code> for resulting Activations to fire.</para>

    <programlisting>ruleBase.addPackage( pkg );  // Add a package instance
ruleBase.removePackage( "org.com.sample" );  // remove a package, and all its parts, by it's namespace
ruleBase.removeRule( "org.com.sample", "my rule" ); // remove a specific rule from a namespace         </programlisting>

    <para>While there is a method to remove an indivual rule, there is no
    method to add an individual rule - to achieve this just add a new package
    with a single rule in it.</para>

    <para><code>RuleBaseConfigurator</code> can be used to specify additional behavior of
    the <code>RuleBase</code>. <code>RuleBaseConfiguration</code> is set to immutable after it has been
    added to a <code>RuleBase</code>. Nearly all the engine optimizations can be turned on
    and off from here, and also the execution behavior can be set. Users will
    generally be concerned with insertion behavior (identity or equality) and
    cross product behavior(remove or keep identity equals cross
    products).</para>

    <programlisting>RuleBaseConfiguration conf = new RuleBaseConfiguration();
conf.setAssertBehaviour( AssertBehaviour.IDENTITY );
conf.setRemoveIdentities( true );
RuleBase ruleBase = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase( conf );</programlisting>

    <para>It holds references to all data that has been "inserted" into it
    (until retracted) and it is the place where the interaction with your
    application occurs. Working memories are stateful objects. They may be
    shortlived or longlived.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Facts</title>

      <para>Facts are objects (beans) from your application that you insert
      into the working memory. Facts are any Java objects which the rules can
      access. The rule engine does not "clone" facts at all, it is all
      references/pointers at the end of the day. Facts are your applications
      data. Strings and other classes without getters and setters are not
      valid Facts and can't be used with Field Constraints which rely on the
      JavaBean standard of getters and setters to interact with the
      object.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Insertion</title>

      <para>"Insert" is the act of telling the <code>WorkingMemory</code> about the facts.
      <code>WorkingMemory.insert(yourObject)</code> for example. When you insert a fact, it
      is examined for matches against the rules etc. This means <emphasis>ALL</emphasis> of the
      work is done during insertion; however, no rules are executed until you
      call <code>fireAllRules()</code>. You don't call <code>fireAllRules()</code> until after you
      have finished inserting your facts. This is a common misunderstanding by
      people who think the work happens when you call <code>fireAllRules()</code>. Expert
      systems typically use the term <code>assert</code> or <code>assertion</code> to refer to facts
      made available to the system, however due to the <code>assert</code> become a keyword
      in most languages we have moved to use the <code>Insert</code> keyword; so expect
      to hear the two used interchangeably.</para>

      <!-- FIXME - I think we might want to add this sentence to the previous paragraph.
        However, when the rules are executed, they can assert new objects 
        thus causing new work to be needed. 
      -->

      <para>When an Object is inserted it returns a <code>FactHandle</code>. This <code>FactHandle</code>
      is the token used to represent your insert Object inside the
      <code>WorkingMemory</code>, it will be used when interacting with the <code>WorkingMemory</code>
      when you wish to retract or modify an object.</para>

      <programlisting>Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = session.insert( stilton );      </programlisting>

      <para>As mentioned in the Rule Base section a Working Memory may operate
      in two assertions modes equality and identity - identity is
      default.</para>

      <para>Identity means the Working Memory uses an <code>IdentityHashMap</code> to store
      all asserted Objects. New instance assertions always result in the
      return of a new <code>FactHandle</code>, if an instance is asserted twice then it
      returns the previous fact handle – i.e. it ignores the second insertion
      for the same fact.</para>

      <para>Equality means the Working Memory uses a <code>HashMap</code> to store all
      asserted Objects. New instance assertions will only return a new
      <code>FactHandle</code> if a not equal classes have been asserted.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Retraction</title>

      <para>"Retraction" is when you retract a fact from the Working Memory,
      which means it will no longer track and match that fact, and any rules
      that are activated and dependent on that fact will be cancelled. Note
      that it is possible to have rules that depend on the "non existence" of
      a fact, in which case retracting a fact may cause a rule to activate
      (see the 'not' and 'exist' keywords). Retraction is done using the
      FactHandle that was returned during the assert.</para>

      <programlisting>Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = session.insert( stilton );
....
session.retract( stiltonHandle );            </programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Update</title>

      <para>The Rule Engine must be notified of modified Facts, so that it can
      be re-processed. Modification internally is actually a retract and then an
      insert; so it clears the WorkingMemory and then starts again. Use the
      modifyObject method to notify the Working Memory of changed objects, for
      objects that are not able to notify the Working Memory themselves.
      Notice modifyObject always takes the modified object as a second
      parameter - this allows you to specify new instances for immutable
      objects. The update() method can only be used with objects that have
      shadow proxies turned on. If you do not use shadow proxies then you must
      call session.modifyRetract() before making your changes and
      session.modifyInsert() after the changes.</para>

      <programlisting>Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = workingMemory.insert( stilton );
....
stilton.setPrice( 100 );
workingMemory.update( stiltonHandle, stilton );              </programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Globals</title>

      <para>Globals are named objects that can be passed in to the rule
      engine; without needing to insert them. Most often these are used for
      static information, or services that are used in the RHS of a rule, or
      perhaps a means to return objects from the rule engine. If you use a
      global on the LHS of a rule, make sure it is immutable. A global must
      first be declared in the drl before it can be set on the session.</para>

      <programlisting>global java.util.List list        </programlisting>

      <para>With the Rule Base now aware of the global identifier and its type
      any sessions are now able to call session.setGlobal; failure to declare
      the global type and identifier first will result in an exception being
      thrown. To set the global on the session use
      session.setGlobal(identifier, value);</para>

      <programlisting>List list = new ArrayList();
session.setGlobal("list", list);           </programlisting>

      <para>If a rule evaluates on a global before you set it you will get a
      NullPointerException.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Shadow Facts</title>

      <para>A shadow fact is a shallow copy of an asserted object. Shadow
      facts are cached copies of object asserted to the working memory. The
      term shadow facts is commonly known as a feature of JESS (Java Expert
      System Shell).</para>

      <para>The origins of shadow facts traces back to the concept of truth
      maintenance. The basic idea is that an expert system should guarantee
      the derived conclusions are accurate. A running system may alter a fact
      during evaluation. When this occurs, the rule engine must know a
      modification occurred and handle the change appropriately. There's
      generally two ways to guarantee truthfulness. The first is to lock all
      the facts during the inference process. The second is to make a cache
      copy of an object and force all modifications to go through the rule
      engine. This way, the changes are processed in an orderly fashion.
      Shadow facts are particularly important in multi-threaded environments,
      where an engine is shared by multiple sessions. Without truth
      maintenance, a system has a difficult time proving the results are
      accurate. The primary benefit of shadow facts is it makes development
      easier. When developers are forced to keep track of fact modifications,
      it can lead to errors, which are difficult to debug. Building a
      moderately complex system using a rule engine is hard enough without
      adding the burden of tracking changes to facts and when they should
      notify the rule engine.</para>

      <para>Drools 4.0 has full support for Shadow Facts implemented as
      transparent lazy proxies. Shadow facts are enable by default and are not
      visible from external code, not even inside code blocks on rules.</para>

      <remark>I<emphasis role="bold">MPORTANT: </emphasis>since Drools
      implements Shadow Facts as Proxies, the fact classes must <emphasis
      role="bold">either be immutable</emphasis> or <emphasis
      role="bold">should not be final</emphasis>, nor have final methods. If a
      fact class is final or have final methods and is still a mutable class,
      the engine is not able to create a proper shadow fact for it and results
      in unpredictable behavior. </remark>

      <para>Although shadow facts are a great way of ensuring the engine
      integrity, they add some overhead to the the reasoning process. As so,
      Drools 4.0 supports fine grained control over them with the ability to
      enable/disable them for each individual class. </para>

       <section>
        <title>When is it possible to disable Shadow Facts?</title>

        <para>It is possible to disable shadow facts for your classes if you
        meet the following requirements:</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">1. Immutable classes are safe:</emphasis>
        if a class is immutable it does not require shadow facts. Just to
        clarify, a class is immutable from the engine perspective if once an
        instance is asserted into the working memory, no attribute will change
        until it is retracted.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">2. Inside your rules, attributes are only
        changed using modify() blocks:</emphasis> both Drools dialects (MVEL
        and Java) have the modify block construct. If all attribute value
        changes for a given class happen inside modify() blocks, you can
        disable shadow facts for that class.</para>

        <example>
          <title>Example: modify() block using Java dialect</title>

          <programlisting>rule "Eat Cheese"
when
  $p: Person( status == "hungry" )
  $c: Cheese( )
then
  retract( $c );
  modify( $p ) {
      setStatus( "full" ),
      setAge( $p.getAge() + 1 )
  }
end</programlisting>
        </example>

        <example>
          <title>Example: modify() block using MVEL dialect</title>

          <programlisting>rule "Eat Cheese"
  dialect "mvel"

  $p: Person( status == "hungry" )
  $c: Cheese( )
then
  retract( $c );
  modify( $p ) {
      status = "full",
      age = $p.age + 1
  }
end</programlisting>
        </example>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">3. In your application, attributes are
        only changed between calls to modifyRetract() and
        modifyInsert():</emphasis> this way, the engine becomes aware that
        attributes will be changed and can prepare itself for them.</para>

        <title>How to disable Shadow Facts?</title>

        <para>To disable shadow fact for all classes set the following
        property in a configuration file of system property:</para>

        <programlisting>drools.shadowProxy = false</programlisting>

        <para>Alternatively, it is possible to disable through an API
        call:</para>

        <programlisting>RuleBaseConfiguration conf = new RuleBaseConfiguration();
conf.setShadowProxy( false );
...
RuleBase ruleBase = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase( conf );
</programlisting>

        <para>To disable the shadow proxy for a list of classes only, use the
        following property instead, or the equivalent API:</para>

        <programlisting>drools.shadowproxy.exclude = org.domainy.* org.domainx.ClassZ</programlisting>

        <para>As shown above, a space separated list is used to specify more
        than one class, and '*' is used as a wild card.</para>

      <title>Property Change Listener</title>

      <para>If your fact objects are Java Beans, you can implement a property
      change listener for them, and then tell the rule engine about it. This
      means that the engine will automatically know when a fact has changed,
      and behave accordingly (you don't need to tell it that it is modified).
      There are proxy libraries that can help automate this (a future version
      of Drools will bundle some to make it easier). To use the Object in
      dynamic mode specify true for the second assertObject parameter.</para>

      <programlisting>Cheese stilton = new Cheese("stilton");
FactHandle stiltonHandle = workingMemory.insert( stilton, true );  //specifies that this is a dynamic fact            </programlisting>

      <para>To make a JavaBean dynamic add a PropertyChangeSupport field
      memory along with two add/remove mothods and make sure that each setter
      notifies the PropertyChangeSupport instance of the change.</para>

      <programlisting>private final PropertyChangeSupport changes = new PropertyChangeSupport( this );
...
public void addPropertyChangeListener(final PropertyChangeListener l) {
    this.changes.addPropertyChangeListener( l );
}

public void removePropertyChangeListener(final PropertyChangeListener l) {
    this.changes.removePropertyChangeListener( l );
}
...

public void setState(final String newState) {
    String oldState = this.state;
    this.state = newState;
    this.changes.firePropertyChange( "state",
                                      oldState,
                                      newState );
}              </programlisting>

    <section>
      <title>Initial Fact</title>

      <para>To support conditional elements like "not" (which will be covered
      later on), there is a need to "seed" the engine with something known as
      the "Initial Fact". This fact is a special fact that is not intended to
      be seen by the user.</para>

      <para>On the first working memory action (assert, fireAllRules) on a
      fresh working memory, the Initial Fact will be propagated through the
      RETE network. This allows rules that have no LHS, or perhaps do not use
      normal facts (such as rules that use "from" to pull data from an
      external source). For instance, if a new working memory is created, and
      no facts are asserted, calling the fireAllRules will cause the Initial
      Fact to propagate, possibly activating rules (otherwise, nothing would
      happen as there is no other fact to start with).</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The StatefulSession extends the WorkingMemory class. It simply adds
    async methods and a dispose() method. The ruleBase retains a reference to
    each StatefulSession it creates, so that it can update them when new rules
    are added, dispose() is needed to release the StatefulSession reference
    from the RuleBase, without it you can get memory leaks.</para>

    <example>

                     format="PNG" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The StatelessSession wraps the WorkingMemory, instead of extending
    it, its main focus is on decision service type scenarios.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Createing a StatelessSession</title>

      <programlisting>StatelessSession session = ruleBase.newStatelessSession();
session.execute( new Cheese( "cheddar" ) );</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The API is reduced for the problem domain and is thus much simpler;
    which in turn can make maintenance of those services easier. The RuleBase
    never retains a reference to the StatelessSession, thus dispose() is not
    needed, and they only have an execute() method that takes an object, an
    array of objects or a collection of objects - there is no insert or
    fireAllRules. The execute method iterates the objects inserting each and
    calling fireAllRules() at the end; session finished. Should the session
    need access to any results information they can use the executeWithResults
    method, which returns a StatelessSessionResult. The reason for this is in
    remoting situations you do not always want the return payload, so this way
    it's optional.</para>

    <para>setAgendaFilter, setGlobal and setGlobalResolver share their state
    across sessions; so each call to execute() will use the set AgendaFilter,
    or see any previous set globals etc.</para>

    <para>StatelessSessions do not currently support
    propertyChangeListeners.</para>

    <para>Async versions of the Execute method are supported, remember to
    override the ExecutorService implementation when in special managed thread
    environments such as JEE.</para>

    <para>StatelessSessions also support sequential mode, which is a special
    optimized mode that uses less memory and executes faster; please see the
    Sequential section for more details.</para>

    <figure>
      <title>StatelessSessionResult</title>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>StatelessSession.executeWithResults(....) returns a minimal api to
    examine the session's data. The inserted Objects can be iterated over,
    queries can be executed and globals retrieved. Once the
    StatelessSessionResult is serialized it loses the reference to the
    underlying WorkingMemory and RuleBase, so queries can no longer be
    executed, however globals can still be retrieved and objects iterated. To
    retrieve globals they must be exported from the StatelessSession; the
    GlobalExporter strategy is set with StatelessSession.setGlobalExporter(
    GlobalExporter globalExporter ). Two implementations of GlobalExporter are
    available and users may implement their own strategies.
    CopyIdentifiersGlobalExporter copies named identifiers into a new
    GlobalResovler that is passed to the StatelessSessionResult; the
    constructor takes a String[] array of identifiers, if no identifiers are
    specified it copies all identifiers declared in the RuleBase.
    ReferenceOriginalGlobalExporter just passes a reference to the original
    Global Resolver; the latter should be used with care as identifier
    instances can be changed at any time by the StatelessSession and the
    GlobalResolver may not be serializable friendly.</para>

    <example>
      <title>GlobalExporter with StatelessSessions</title>

      <programlisting>StatelessSession session = ruleBase.newStatelessSession();
session.setGlobalExporter( new CopyIdentifiersGlobalExporter( new String[]{"list"} ) );
StatelessSessionResult result = session.executeWithResults( new Cheese( "stilton" ) );
List list = ( List ) result.getGlobal( "list" );</programlisting>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The Agenda is a RETE feature. During a Working Memory Action rules
    may become fully matched and eligible for execution; a single Working
    Memory Action can result in multiple eligible rules. When a rule is fully
    matched an Activation is created, referencing the Rule and the matched
    facts, and placed onto the Agenda. The Agenda controls the execution order
    of these Activations using a Conflict Resolution strategy.</para>

    <para>The engine operates in a "2 phase" mode which is recursive:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Working Memory Actions - this is where most of the work takes
        place - in either the Consequence or the main Java application
        process. Once the Consequence has finished or the main Java
        application process calls fireAllRules() the engine switches to the
        Agenda Evaluation phase.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Agenda Evaluation - attempts to select a rule to fire, if a rule
        is not found it exits, otherwise it attempts to fire the found rule,
        switching the phase back to Working Memory Actions and the process
        repeats again until the Agenda is empty.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <figure>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The process recurses until the agenda is clear, in which case
    control returns to the calling application. When Working Memory Actions
    are taking place, no rules are being fired.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Conflict Resolution</title>

      <para>Conflict resolution is required when there are multiple rules on
      the agenda. As firing a rule may have side effects on working memory,
      the rule engine needs to know in what order the rules should fire (for
      instance, firing ruleA may cause ruleB to be removed from the
      agenda).</para>

      <para>The default conflict resolution strategies employed by Drools are:
      Salience and LIFO (last in, first out).</para>

      <para>The most visible one is "salience" or priority, in which case a
      user can specify that a certain rule has a higher priority (by giving it
      a higher number) than other rules. In that case, the higher salience
      rule will always be preferred. LIFO priorities are based on the assigned
      Working Memory Action counter value, multiple rules created from the
      same action have the same value - execution of these are considered
      arbitrary.</para>

      <para>As a general rule, it is a good idea not to count on the rules
      firing in any particular order, and try and author the rules without
      worrying about a "flow".</para>

      <para>Custom conflict resolution strategies can be specified by setting
      the Class in the RuleBaseConfiguration method setConflictResolver, or
      using the property "drools.conflictResolver".</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Agenda Groups</title>

      <para>Agenda groups are a way to partition rules (activations, actually)
      on the agenda. At any one time, only one group has "focus" which means
      that the activations for rules in that group will only take effect - you
      can also have rules "auto focus" which means the focus for its agenda
      group is taken when that rules conditions are true.</para>

      <para>They are sometimes known as "modules" in CLIPS terminology. Agenda
      groups are a handy way to create a "flow" between grouped rules. You can
      switch the group which has focus either from within the rule engine, or
      from the API. If your rules have a clear need for multiple "phases" or
      "sequences" of processing, consider using agenda-groups for this
      purpose.</para>

      <para>Each time setFocus(...) is called it pushes that Agenda Group onto
      a stack, when the focus group is empty it is popped off and the next one
      on the stack evaluates. An Agenda Group can appear in multiple locations
      on the stack. The default Agenda Group is "MAIN", all rules which do not
      specify an Agenda Group are placed there, it is also always the first
      group on the Stack and given focus as default.</para>

      <para>Filters are optional implementations of the filter interface
      which are used to allow/or deny an activation from firing (what you
      filter on, is entirely up to the implementation). Drools provides the
      following convenience default implementations</para>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>To use a filter specify it while calling FireAllRules. The
      following example will only allow activation of rules ending with the test <emphasis>Test</emphasis>. All others will be filtered out:</para>

    <title>Truth Maintenance with <indexterm>
        <primary>Logical Object</primary>
      </indexterm> Logical Objects</title>

    <para>In a regular insert, you need to explicitly retract a fact. With
    logical assertions, the fact that was asserted will be automatically
    retracted when the conditions that asserted it in the first place are no
    longer true. (It's actually more clever then that! If there are no possible
    conditions that could support the logical assertion, only then it will be
    retracted).</para>

    <para>Normal insertions are said to be “STATED” (ie The Fact has been
    stated - just like the intuitive concept). Using a HashMap and a counter
    we track how many times a particular equality is STATED; this means we
    count how many different instances are equal. When we logically insert an
    object we are said to justify it and it is justified by the firing rule.
    For each logical insertion there can only be one equal object, each
    subsequent equal logical insertion increases the justification counter for
    this logical assertion. As each justification is removed when we have no
    more justifications the logical object is automatically retracted.</para>

    <para>If we logically insert an object when there is an equal STATED
    object it will fail and return null. If we STATE an object that has an
    existing equal object that is JUSTIFIED we override the Fact - how this
    override works depends on the configuration setting
    "WM_BEHAVIOR_PRESERVE". When the property is set to discard we use the
    existing handle and replace the existing instance with the new Object -
    this is the default behavior - otherwise we override it to STATED but we
    create an new FactHandle.</para>

    <para>This can be confusing on a first read, so hopefully the flow charts
    below help. When it says that it returns a new FactHandle, this also
    indicates the Object was propagated through the network.</para>

      <title>Example Scenario</title>

      <para>An example may make things clearer. Imagine a credit card
      processing application, processing transactions for a given account (and
      we have a working memory accumulating knowledge about a single accounts
      transaction). The rule engine is doing its best to decide if
      transactions are possibly fraudulent or not. Imagine this rule base
      basically has rules that kick in when there is "reason to be suspicious"
      and when "everything is normal".</para>

      <para>Of course there are many rules that operate no matter what
      (performing standard calculations, etc.). Now there are possibly many
      reasons as to what could trigger a "reason to be suspicious": someone
      notifying the bank, a sequence of large transactions, transactions for
      geographically disparate locations or even reports of credit card theft.
      Rather then smattering all the little conditions in lots of rules,
      imagine there is a fact class called "SuspiciousAccount".</para>

      <para>Then there can be a series of rules whose job is to look for
      things that may raise suspicion, and if they fire, they simply insert a
      new SuspiciousAccount() instance. All the other rules just have
      conditions like "not SuspiciousAccount()" or "SuspiciousAccount()"
      depending on their needs. Note that this has the advantage of allowing
      there to be many rules around raising suspicion, without touching the
      other rules. When the facts causing the SuspiciousAccount() insertion
      are removed, the rule engine reverts back to the normal "mode" of
      operation (and for instance, a rule with "not SuspiciousAccount()" may
      kick in which flushes through any interrupted transactions).</para>

      <para>If you have followed this far, you will note that truth
      maintenance, like logical assertions, allows rules to behave a little
      like a human would, and can certainly make the rules more
      manageable.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Important note: Equality for Java objects</title>

      <para>It is important to note that for Truth Maintenance (and logical
      assertions) to work at all, your Fact objects (which may be Javabeans)
      override equals and hashCode methods (from java.lang.Object) correctly.
      As the truth maintenance system needs to know when 2 different physical
      objects are equal in value, BOTH equals and hashCode must be overridden
      correctly, as per the Java standard.</para>

      <para>Two objects are equal if and only if their equals methods return
      true for each other and if their hashCode methods return the same
      values. See the Java API for more details (but do keep in mind you MUST
      override both equals and hashCode).</para>

    <title>Event Model</title>

    <para>The event package provides means to be notified of rule engine
    events, including rules firing, objects being asserted, etc. This allows
    you to separate out logging/auditing activities from the main part of your
    application (and the rules) - as events are a cross cutting
    concern.</para>

    <para>There are three types of event listeners -
    WorkingMemoryEventListener, AgendaEventListener
    RuleFlowEventListener.</para>

    </figure>

    <para>All EventListeners have default implementations that implement each
    method, but do nothing, these are convienience classes that you can
    inherit from to save having to implement each method -
    DefaultAgendaEventListener, DefaultWorkingMemoryEventListener,
    DefaultRuleFlowEventListener. The following shows how to extend
    DefaultAgendaEventListener and add it to the session - the example prints
    statements for only when rules are fired:</para>

    <programlisting>session.addEventListener( new DefaultAgendaEventListener() {                            
   public void afterActivationFired(AfterActivationFiredEvent event) {
       super.afterActivationFired( event );
       System.out.println( event );
   }
});       </programlisting>

    <para>Drools also provides DebugWorkingMemoryEventListener,
    DebugAgendaEventListener and DebugRuleFlowEventListener that implements
    each method with a debug print statement:</para>

    <programlisting>session.addEventListener( new DebugWorkingMemoryEventListener() );        </programlisting>

    <para>The Eclipse-based Rule IDE also provides an audit logger and
    graphical viewer, so that the rule engine can log events for later
    viewing, and auditing.</para>

    <title>Sequential Mode</title>

    <para>With Rete you have a stateful session where objects can be asserted
    and modified over time, rules can also be added and removed. Now what
    happens if we assume a stateless session, where after the initial data set
    no more data can be asserted or modified (no rule re-evaluations) and
    rules cannot be added or removed? This means we can start to make
    assumptions to minimize what work the engine has to do.</para>

    <para>The LeftInputAdapterNode no longer creates a Tuple, adding the
    Object, and then propagate the Tuple – instead a Command Object is created
    and added to a list in the Working Memory. This Command Object holds a
    reference to the LeftInputAdapterNode and the propagated Object. This
    stops any left-input propagations at insertion time, so that we know that
    a right-input propagation will never need to attempt a join with the
    left-inputs (removing the need for left-input memory). All nodes have
    their memory turned off, including the left-input Tuple memory but
    excluding the right-input Object memory – i.e. The only node that
    remembers an insertion propagation is the right-input Object memory. Once
    all the assertions are finished, and all right-input memories populated,
    we can then iterate the list of LeftInputAdatperNode Command objects
    calling each in turn; they will propagate down the network attempting to
    join with the right-input objects; not being remembered in the left input,
    as we know there will be no further object assertions and thus
    propagations into the right-input memory.</para>

    <para>There is no longer an Agenda, with a priority queue to schedule the
    Tuples, instead there is simply an array for the number of rules. The
    sequence number of the RuleTerminalNode indicates the element with the
    array to place the Activation. Once all Command Objects have finished we
    can iterate our array checking each element in turn and firing the
    Activations if they exist. To improve performance in the array we remember
    record the first and last populated cells. The network is constructed
    where each RuleTerminalNode is given a sequence number, based on a
    salience number and its order of being added to the network.</para>

    <para>Typically the right-input node memories are HashMaps, for fast
    Object retraction, as we know there will be no Object retractions, we can
    use a list when the values of the Object are not indexed. For larger
    numbers of Objects indexed HashMaps provide a performance increase; if we
    know an Object type has a low number of instances then indexing is
    probably not of an advantage and an Object list can be used.</para>

    <para>Sequential mode can only be used with a StatelessSession and is off
    by default. To turn on either set the RuleBaseConfiguration.setSequential
    to true or set the rulebase.conf property drools.sequential to true.
    Sequential mode can fallback to a dynamic agenda with setSequentialAgenda
    to either SequentialAgenda.SEQUENTIAL or SequentialAgenda.DYNAMIC setter
    or the "drools.sequential.agenda" property</para>
