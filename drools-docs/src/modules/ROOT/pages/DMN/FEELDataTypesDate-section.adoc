= Dates

FEEL does not have date literals, but the built-in `date()` function can be used to construct
date values. For example,

```
date( "2017-06-23" )
```

The date strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#date[XML Schema Part 2 Datatypes]
document. The format is `"YYYY-MM-DD"` where `YYYY` is the year with 4 digits, `MM` is the number of the month with
2 digits (such as January is 01, February is 02), and `DD` is the number of the day.

Date objects have time part equal to `"00:00:00"`, which is midnight. The dates are considered to be local, without a timezone.
