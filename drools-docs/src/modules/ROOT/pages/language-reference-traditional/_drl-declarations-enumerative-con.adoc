= Enumerative type declarations in DRL

DRL supports the declaration of enumerative types in the format `declare enum <factType>`, followed by a comma-separated list of values ending with a semicolon. You can then use the enumerative list in the rules in the DRL file.

For example, the following enumerative type declaration defines days of the week for an employee scheduling rule:

----
declare enum DaysOfWeek
   SUN("Sunday"),MON("Monday"),TUE("Tuesday"),WED("Wednesday"),THU("Thursday"),FRI("Friday"),SAT("Saturday");

   fullName : String
end

rule "Using a declared Enum"
when
   $emp : Employee( dayOff == DaysOfWeek.MONDAY )
then
   ...
end
