= Advanced rule actions with conditional and named consequences

In general, effective rule actions are small, declarative, and readable. However, in some cases, the limitation of having a single consequence for each rule can be challenging and lead to verbose and repetitive rule syntax, as shown in the following example rules:

.Example rules with verbose and repetitive syntax
[source]
----
rule "Give 10% discount to customers older than 60"
  when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
  then
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
end

rule "Give free parking to customers older than 60"
  when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
    $car : Car( owner == $customer )
  then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
end
----

A partial solution to the repetition is to make the second rule extend the first rule, as shown in the following modified example:

.Partially enhanced example rules with an extended condition
[source]
----
rule "Give 10% discount to customers older than 60"
  when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
  then
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
end

rule "Give free parking to customers older than 60"
    extends "Give 10% discount to customers older than 60"
  when
    $car : Car( owner == $customer )
  then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
end
----

As a more efficient alternative, you can consolidate the two rules into a single rule with modified conditions and labelled corresponding rule actions, as shown in the following consolidated example:

.Consolidated example rule with conditional and named consequences
[source]
----
rule "Give 10% discount and free parking to customers older than 60"
  when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
    do[giveDiscount]
    $car : Car( owner == $customer )
  then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
  then[giveDiscount]
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
end
----

This example rule uses two actions: the usual default action and another action named `giveDiscount`. The `giveDiscount` action is activated in the condition with the keyword `do` when a customer older than 60 years old is found in the KIE base, regardless of whether or not the customer owns a car.

You can configure the activation of a named consequence with an additional condition, such as the `if` statement in the following example. The condition in the `if` statement is always evaluated on the pattern that immediately precedes it.

.Consolidated example rule with an additional condition
[source]
----
rule "Give free parking to customers older than 60 and 10% discount to golden ones among them"
  when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
    if ( type == "Golden" ) do[giveDiscount]
    $car : Car( owner == $customer )
  then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
  then[giveDiscount]
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
end
----

You can also evaluate different rule conditions using a nested `if` and `else if` construct, as shown in the following more complex example:

.Consolidated example rule with more complex conditions
[source]
----
rule "Give free parking and 10% discount to over 60 Golden customer and 5% to Silver ones"
  when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
    if ( type == "Golden" ) do[giveDiscount10]
    else if ( type == "Silver" ) break[giveDiscount5]
    $car : Car( owner == $customer )
  then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
  then[giveDiscount10]
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
  then[giveDiscount5]
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.05 ) };
end
----

This example rule gives a 10% discount and free parking to Golden customers over 60, but only a 5% discount without free parking to Silver customers. The rule activates the consequence named `giveDiscount5` with the keyword `break` instead of `do`. The keyword `do` schedules a consequence in the {DECISION_ENGINE} agenda, enabling the remaining part of the rule conditions to continue being evaluated, while `break` blocks any further condition evaluation. If a named consequence does not correspond to any condition with `do` but is activated with `break`, the rule fails to compile because the conditional part of the rule is never reached.
