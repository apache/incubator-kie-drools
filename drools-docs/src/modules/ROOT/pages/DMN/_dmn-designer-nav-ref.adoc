DMN file and diagram views::
In the upper-left corner of the DMN designer, select the *Project Explorer* view to navigate between all DMN and other files or select the *Decision Navigator* view to navigate between the decision components, graphs, and boxed expressions of a selected DRD:

In the upper-right corner of the DMN designer, select the *Explore diagram* icon to view an elevated preview of the selected DRD and to navigate between the nodes of the selected DRD:
