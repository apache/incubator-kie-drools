= Complex event processing (CEP)

In {PRODUCT}, an event is a record of a significant change of state in the application domain at a point in time. Depending on how the domain is modeled, the change of state may be represented by a single event, multiple atomic events, or hierarchies of correlated events. From a complex event processing (CEP) perspective, an event is a type of fact or object that occurs at a specific point in time, and a business rule is a definition of how to react to the data from that fact or object. For example, in a stock broker application, a change in security prices, a change in ownership from seller to buyer, or a change in an account holder's balance are all considered to be events because a change has occurred in the state of the application domain at a given time.

The {RULE_ENGINE} in {PRODUCT} uses complex event processing (CEP) to detect and process multiple events within a collection of events, to uncover relationships that exist between events, and to infer new data from the events and their relationships.

CEP use cases share several requirements and goals with business rule use cases.

From a business perspective, business rule definitions are often defined based on the occurrence of scenarios triggered by events. In the following examples, events form the basis of business rules:

* In an algorithmic trading application, a rule performs an action if the security price increases by X percent above the day opening price. The price increases are denoted by events on a stock trading application.
* In a monitoring application, a rule performs an action if the temperature in the server room increases X degrees in Y minutes. The sensor readings are denoted by events.

From a technical perspective, business rule evaluation and CEP have the following key similarities:

* Both business rule evaluation and CEP require seamless integration with the enterprise infrastructure and applications. This is particularly important with life-cycle management, auditing, and security.
* Both business rule evaluation and CEP have functional requirements such as pattern matching, and non-functional requirements such as response time limits and query-rule explanations.

CEP scenarios have the following key characteristics:

* Scenarios usually process large numbers of events, but only a small percentage of the events are relevant.
* Events are usually immutable and represent a record of change in state.
* Rules and queries run against events and must react to detected event patterns.
* Related events usually have a strong temporal relationship.
* Individual events are not prioritized. The CEP system prioritizes patterns of related events and the relationships between them.
* Events usually need to be composed and aggregated.

Given these common CEP scenario characteristics, the CEP system in {PRODUCT} supports the following features and functions to optimize event processing:

* Event processing with proper semantics
* Event detection, correlation, aggregation, and composition
* Event stream processing
* Temporal constraints to model the temporal relationships between events
* Sliding windows of significant events
* Session-scoped unified clock
* Required volumes of events for CEP use cases
* Reactive rules
* Adapters for event input into the {RULE_ENGINE} (pipeline)
