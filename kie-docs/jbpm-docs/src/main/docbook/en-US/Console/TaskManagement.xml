                     <para>Tasks can have associated a Form to store data. If tasks are part of a
                            Business Process, usually some data needs to be collected and propagated
                            to the business process for further usage. For that reason, tasks has to
                            provide a way to gather and store data. Forms can be created for
                            specific tasks using the Form Modeller. If no form is provided a dynamic
                            form will be created based on the information that the task needs to
                            handle. If a task is created as an ad-hoc task (not related with any
                            process) there will be no such information to generate a form and only
                            basic actions will be provided. </para>
