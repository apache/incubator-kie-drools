<para>This chapter introduces the API you need to load processes and execute them.  For
  more detail on how to define the processes themselves, check out the chapter on BPMN 2.0.
  </para>

  <para>To interact with the process engine (for example, to start a process), you need
  to set up a session.  This session will be used to communicate with the process engine.
  A session needs to have a reference to a knowledge base, which contains a reference
  to all the relevant process definitions.  This knowledge base is used to look up 
  the process definitions whenever necessary.  To create a session, you first need to create
  a knowledge base, load all the necessary process definitions (this can be from various
  sources, like from classpath, file system or process repository) and then instantiate a
  session.</para>
  
  <para>Once you have set up a session, you can use it to start executing processes.
  Whenever a process is started, a new process instance is created (for that process
  definition) that maintains the state of that specific instance of the process.</para>

  <para>For example, imagine you are writing an application to process sales orders.  You
  could then define one or more process definitions that define how the order should be
  processed.  When starting up your application, you first need to create a knowledge base
  that contains those process definitions.  You can then create a session based on this
  knowledge base so that, whenever a new sales order comes in, a new process instance
  is started for that sales order.  That process instance contains the state of the process
  for that specific sales request.</para>
  
  <para>A knowledge base can be shared across sessions and usually is only created once,
  at the start of the application (as creating a knowledge base can be rather heavy-weight
  as it involves parsing and compiling the process definitions).  Knowledge bases can be
  dynamically changed (so you can add or remove processes at runtime).</para>
  
  <para>Sessions can be created based on a knowledge base and are used to execute processes
  and interact with the engine.  You can create as many independent session as you need and
  creating a session is considered relatively lightweight.  How many sessions you create is
  up to you.  In general, most simple cases start out with creating one session that is then
  called from various places in your application.  You could decide to create multiple sessions
  if for example you want to have multiple independent processing units (for example, if you want
  all processes from one customer to be completely independent from processes for another customer,
  you could create an independent session for each customer) or if you need multiple
  sessions for scalability reasons.  If you don't know what to do, simply start by having
  one knowledge base that contains all your process definitions and create one session that
  you then use to execute all your processes.</para>

  <para>The jBPM project has a clear separation between the API the users should be interacting
  with and the actual implementation classes.  The public API exposes most of the features
  we believe "normal" users can safely use and should remain rather stable across releases.
  Expert users can still access internal classes but should be aware that they should know
  what they are doing and that the internal API might still change in the future.</para>
  
  <para>As explained above, the jBPM API should thus be used to (1) create a knowledge base
  that contains your process definitions, and to (2) create a session to start new process
  instances, signal existing ones, register listeners, etc.</para>
