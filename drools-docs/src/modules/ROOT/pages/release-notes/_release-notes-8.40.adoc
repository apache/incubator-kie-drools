== 8.40.0.Final release notes

=== `kie-maven-plugin` update with maven compiler release

In order to make the `kie-maven-plugin` compatible with Maven-based project using a more recent version of the JDK, the plugin will now also look at the `maven.compiler.release` property to infer the language level to use during the build, with precedence over the `java.version` property (old behaviour).

When the `kie-maven-plugin` is used in a Maven-based project, we recommend NOT to set the `drools.dialect.java.compiler.lnglevel` in your KJAR project, so that the version of the JDK to be used is the one fully governed by the whole Maven build (including Java source files).
