= Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[_our CTO Chris Wright's message_].
