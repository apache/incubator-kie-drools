# dep-graph-extractor

A small Maven extension that dumps the reactor's module dependency graph to a TSV
file, then aborts the build before any goals run.

Used by [`CiComputeBuildScopes`](../CiComputeBuildScopes.java) to figure out, from a
list of changed files, which modules need to be rebuilt and retested.

## What it writes

One file at the path given by `-DdepGraphExtractor.out=<path>` (default `dep-graph.tsv`),
with three record kinds:

```
P    groupId:artifactId    /abs/path/to/module            # one per reactor module
D    groupId:artifactId    upstream-groupId:artifactId    # one per direct dep edge
B    groupId:artifactId                                   # marks an in-reactor BOM
```

> Separators in the TSV are \<TAB> entries.

- `P` records list every module in the reactor along with its absolute basedir on disk.
Consumers use them to map `groupId:artifactId` back to a path so changed files can be
attributed to the module they live under.

- `D` edges include both regular `<dependency>` edges (via Maven's `ProjectDependencyGraph`)
and `<scope>import</scope>` BOM edges from `<dependencyManagement>` — the latter are
invisible to the standard graph but matter for change propagation, so we read them off
the original POM model and emit them too.

- `B` records call out which of the modules listed in `P` are in-reactor BOMs (a module
that other modules import via `<scope>import</scope>`). Downstream tooling like
`CiSummary` uses this to render BOM modules differently from regular modules.

## Why it aborts

The extension's only job is to capture the graph; once the TSV is written, running the
actual build would be wasted work — so it calls `System.exit(0)` from
`afterProjectsRead`.

## Tests

There are no tests in this directory. The extension's behavior is exercised end-to-end
by [`CiComputeBuildScopesTest`](../tests/CiComputeBuildScopesTest.java), which builds
the extension, runs it against the real reactor, and snapshot-tests the resulting
`changed` / `affected` / `upstream` lists.
