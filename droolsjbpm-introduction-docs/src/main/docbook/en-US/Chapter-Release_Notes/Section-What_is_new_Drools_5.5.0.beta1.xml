    <section>
      <title>Grouped accessors for nested objects</title>

      <para>We already allow nested accessors to be used as follows, where address is the nested object:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name == "mark", address.city == "london", address.country == "uk" )</programlisting>

      <para>Now these accessors to nested objects can be grouped with a '.(...)' syntax providing more readable rules as
      it follows:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name==  "mark", address.( city == "london", country ==  "uk") )</programlisting>

      <para>Note the '.' prefix, this is necessary to differentiate the nested object constrtaints from a method
      call.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Inline casts and coercion</title>

      <para>When dealing with nested objects, we may need to cast to a subtype. Now it is possible to do that via the #
      symbol as in:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name=="mark", address#LongAddress.country == "uk" )</programlisting>

      <para>This example casts Address to LongAddress, making its getters available. If the cast is not possible
      (instanceof returns false), the evaluation will be considered false. Also fully qualified names are
      supported:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name=="mark", address#org.domain.LongAddress.country == "uk" )</programlisting>

      <para>It is possible to use multiple inline casts in the same expression:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name == "mark", address#LongAddress.country#DetailedCountry.population &gt; 10000000 )</programlisting>

      <para>moreover, since we also support the instanceof operator, if that is used we will infer its results for
      further uses of that field, within that pattern:</para>

      <programlisting>Person(  name=="mark", address instanceof LongAddress, address.country == "uk" )</programlisting>

      <title>Improved consistency of BRL editor</title>

      <para>The Guided Rule Editor (BRL) has been made more consistent with the other editors in Guvnor.</para>

      (THEN).</para>

      <title>Exposure of non-Java Bean compliant class members</title>

      <para>In response to a request (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/GUVNOR-1756) to be able to build a rule that bound
      a variable to the size of a java.util.List we have now exposed model class members that do not adhere to the Java
      Bean conventions. i.e. you can now select model class members that are not "getXXX" or "setXXX".</para>

      <para>If you import a Java POJO model be prepared to see more members listed than you may have had
      previously.</para>

      <title>Valid indicator for assets</title>

      <para>A valid indicator has now been added to the asset lists as well as the asset editors. The indicator shows
      whether an asset is valid, invalid or if the validity of the asset is undetermined. For already existing assets
      the validity of the asset will remain undetermined until the next time either validation is run on the asset or
      the asset has been saved again.</para>

      <title>Guided rule editor supports "entry-points" in Accumlates and Collects</title>

      <para>The guided rule editor now supports nesting entry-points in "from accumulate" and "from collect" constructs.
      Define a "from accumulate" or "from collect" in the usual manner and then choose "from entry-point" when defining
      the inner pattern. This feature is also available in Rule Templates and the guided web-based Decision Table's BRL
      fragment columns.</para>

      <title>Guided Decision Table receives an Audit Log</title>

      <para>An audit log has been added to the web-guided Decision Table editor to track additions, deletions and
      modifications.</para>

      <para>By default the audit log is not configured to record any events, however, users can easily select the events
      in which they are interested.</para>

      <para>The audit log is persisted whenever the asset is checked in.</para>

      <para>Once the capture of events has been enabled all susbsequent operations are recorded. Users are able to
      perform the following:-</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Record an explanatory note beside each event.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Delete an event from the log. Event details remain in the underlying repository.</para>

      <title>Simulation Testing (unfinished prototype)</title>

      <para>Simulation testing allows you to test a sequence of events in Guvnor. This is very usefull for testing CEP
      use cases.</para>

      <para>The example below shows a testcase that calls <literal>fireAllRules</literal> twice: once after a little
      over 3 seconds and once after a little over 5 seconds:</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Prototype of the simulation testing GUI</title>

        <mediaobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Each simulation consists out of a number of paths: in the example above there is only 1 path. Each path
      consists out of number of steps: in the example above there are 3 steps. Notice how the timeline overview shows
      the steps and their relative time distance. The timeline can zoom in and out.</para>

      <para>Each step consist out of a number of actions: in the example above, the second step at 3 seconds does 2
      actions: fire all rules and data assertion. Actions, steps and paths can be added, moved and removed as
      needed.</para>

      <para>For more information, take a look at <link
      xlink:href="http://blog.athico.com/2012/08/simulation-testing-in-guvnor-first.html">the simulation testing
      video</link>. A simulation test asset stored in 5.5.0.Beta1 will not be readable in 5.5.0.Beta2. Feedback is
      welcome.</para>
