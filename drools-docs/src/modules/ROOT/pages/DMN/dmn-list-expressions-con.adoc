= Boxed list expressions

A boxed list expression in DMN represents a FEEL list of items. You use boxed lists to define lists of relevant items for a particular node in a decision. You can also use literal FEEL expressions for list items in cells to create more complex lists.

For example, the following boxed list expression identifies approved credit score agencies in a loan application decision service:

The following boxed list expression also identifies approved credit score agencies but uses FEEL logic to define the agency status (Inc., LLC, SA, GA) based on a DMN input node:
