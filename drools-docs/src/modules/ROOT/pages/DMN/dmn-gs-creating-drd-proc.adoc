= Creating the traffic violations DMN decision requirements diagram (DRD)

A decision requirements diagram (DRD) is a visual representation of your DMN model. Use the  DMN designer in {CENTRAL} to design the DRD for the traffic violations project and to define the decision logic of the DRD components.

. On the *Add Asset* page, click *DMN*. The *Create new DMN* window is opened.
.. In the *Create new DMN* window, enter `Traffic Violation` in the *DMN* name field.
.. From the *Package* list, select `com.myspace.traffic_violation`.

. Double-click the decision node and rename it to `Should the driver be suspended?`.
. Click the *Driver* input node, select the *Create DMN Information Requirement* icon and click the *Should the driver be suspended?* decision node to link the two nodes.

NOTE: As you periodically save a DRD, the DMN designer performs a static validation of the DMN model and might produce error messages until the model is defined completely. After you finish defining the DMN model completely, if any errors remain, troubleshoot the specified problems accordingly.
