    <title>Dependencies </title>
  <para>The project may have any number of either internal or external dependencies. Dependency is a project that has

    workbench as the project. External dependencies are retrieved from repositories outside
    of the current workbench. Each dependency uses the GAV-values to specify the project name and version that is used
    by the project. </para>

    <title>Import Suggestions </title>
  <para>Import Suggestions lists imports that are used as suggestions when using the guided editors the workbench has.
        Making it easier to work with the workbench, as there is no need to type each import in each file that uses the
        import.</para>
    
    <note><para>Unlike in the previous version of Guvnor. The imports listed in the import suggestions are not automatically added
      into the knowledge base or into the packages of the workbench. Each import needs to be explicitly added into
      each file.</para></note>
