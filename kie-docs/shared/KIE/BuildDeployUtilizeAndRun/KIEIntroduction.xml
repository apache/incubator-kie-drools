  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>6.0 introduces a new configuration and convention approach to building knowledge bases,
    instead of the using the programmatic builder approach in 5.x. Atlhough a builder is still
    available to fall back on, as it's used for the tooling integration.</para>
  <para>Building now uses Maven, and aligns with Maven practices. A KIE projcet or module is simply
    a Maven java project or module; with an additional meta data file META-INF/kmodule.xml. The
    kmodule.xml file is the descriptor that selects resources to knowledge bases and configures
    those knowledge bases and sessions. There is also alternative xml support via Spring and OSGi
    BluePrints.</para>
  <para>While standard Maven can build and package KIE resources, it will not provide validation at
    build time. There is a Maven plugin which is recommend to use to get build time validation. The
    plugin also pre-genenerates many classes, making the runtime loading faster too.</para>

  <para>KIE uses defaults to minimise the amount of configuration. With an empty kmodule.xml being
    the simplest configuration. There must always be a kmodule.xml file, even if empty, as it's used
    for discover of the jar and it's contents.</para>
  <para>Maven can either 'mvn install' to deploy a KieModule to the local machine, where all other
    applications on the local machine use it. Or it can 'mvn 'deploy' to push the KieModule to a
    remote Maven repository. Building the Application wil pull in the KieModule, popualting it's
    local Maven repository, as it does so.</para>

  <para>Jars can be deployed in one of two ways. Either added to the classpath, like any other jar
    in a Maven dependency listing, or they can be dynamically loaded at runtime. KIE will scan the
    classpath to find all the jars with a kmodule.xml in it. Each found jar is represented by the
    KieModule interface. The term Classpath KieModules and dynamic KieModule is used to refer to the
    two loading approaches. While dynamic modules supports side by side versioning, classpath
    modules do not. Further once module is on the classpath, no other version may be loaded
    dynamically.</para>
  <para>Detailed referencs for the api are included in the next sections, the impatiant can jump
    straight to the examples section, which is fairly intuitive for the different use cases.</para>
