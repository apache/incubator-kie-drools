      <title>General</title>

      <para>Many things are changing for Drools 6.0.</para>

      <para>Along with the functional and feature changes we have restructured
      the <link
      xlink:href="https://github.com/droolsjbpm/guvnor">Guvnor</link> github
      repository to better reflect our new architecture. Guvnor has
      historically been the web application for Drools. It was a composition
      of editors specific to Drools, a back-end repository and a simplistic
      asset management system.</para>

      <para>Things are now different.</para>

      <para>For Drools 6.0 the web application has been extensively re-written
      to use <link
      xlink:href="http://droolsjbpm.github.io/uberfire/">UberFire</link> that
      provides a generic Workbench environment, a Metadata Engine, Security
      Framework, a VFS API and clustering support.</para>

      <para>Guvnor has become a generic asset management framework providing
      common services for generic projects and their dependencies. Drools use
      of both UberFire and Guvnor has born the Drools Workbench.</para>

      <para>A picture always helps:</para>

        <para>UberFire is the foundation of all components for both Drools and
        jBPM. Every editor and service leverages UberFire. Components can be
        mixed and matched into either a full featured application of used in
        isolation.</para>

        <para>Guvnor adds project services and dependency management to the
        mix.</para>

        <para>At present Guvnor consists of few parts; being principally a
        port of common project services that existed in the old Guvnor. As
        things settle down and the module matures pluggable workflow will be
        supported allowing for sensitive operations to be controlled by jBPM
        processes and rules. Work is already underway to include this for
        6.0.</para>

        <para>Both Drools and jBPM editors and services share the need for a
        common set of re-usable screens, services and widgets.</para>

        <para>Rather than pollute Guvnor with screens and services needed only
        by Drools and jBPM this module contains such common
        dependencies.</para>

        <para>It is possible to just re-use the UberFire and Guvnor stack to
        create your own project-based workbench type application and take
        advantage of the underlying services.</para>

        (drools-wb)</link></title>

        <para>Drools Workbench is the end product for people looking for a web
        application that is composed of all Drools related editors, screens
        and services. It is equivalent to the old Guvnor.</para>

        <para>Looking for the web application to accompany Drools Expert and
        Drools Fusion; an environment to author, test and deploy rules. This
        is what you're looking for.</para>

        <para>KIE Drools Workbench (for want of a better name - it's amazing
        how difficult names can be) is an extension of Drools Workbench
        including jBPM Designer to support Rule Flow.</para>

        <para>jBPM Designer, now being an UberFire compatible component, does
        not need to be deployed as a separate web application. We bundle it
        here, along with Drools as a convenience for people looking to author
        Rule Flows along side their rules.</para>

        <para>This is the daddy of them all.</para>

        <para>KIE Workbench is the composition of everything known to man;
        from both the Drools and jBPM worlds. It provides for authoring of
        projects, data models, guided rules, decision tables etc, test
        services, process authoring, a process run-time execution environment
        and human task interaction.</para>

        <para>KIE Workbench is the old Guvnor, jBPM Designer and jBPM Console
        applications combined. On steroids.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The World is not enough?</title>

        <para>You may have noticed; KIE Drools Workbench and KIE Workbench are
        in the same repository. This highlights a great thing about the new
        module design we have with UberFire. Web applications are just a
        composition of dependencies.</para>

        <para>You want your own web application that consists of just the
        Guided Rule Editor and jBPM Designer? You want your own web
        application that has the the Data Modeller and some of your own
        screens?</para>

        <para>Pick your dependencies and add them to your own UberFire
        compliant web application and, as the saying goes, the world is your
        oyster.</para>

      <title>UberFire Provided Infrastructure</title>

      <section>
        <title>Virtual File System</title>

        <para>UberFire VFS is a <link
        xlink:href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=203">NIO.2</link> based
        API that provides a unified interface to access different file systems
        - by default it uses <link xlink:href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</link>
        as its primary backend implematation. Resources (ie. files and
        directories) are represented, as proposed by NIO.2, as URIs. Here are
        some examples:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>file:///path/to/some/file.txt</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>git://repository-name/path/to/file.txt</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>git://repository-name/path/to/dir/</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>git://my_branch@repository-name/path/to/file.txt</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>By using Git as its default implementation, UberFire VFS
        provides out-of-box a versioned system, which means that every
        information stored/deleted has its history preserved.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Your system doesn't need to have GIT installed, UberFire uses
          <link xlink:href="http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/">JGIT</link>
          internally, a 100% Java based Git implementation.</para>
        </important>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Metadata Engine</title>

        <para>Metadata engine provides two complementary services: Indexing
        and Searching. Both services were designed to be as minimum invasive
        as possible and, in the same time, providing all the complex features
        needed by the subject.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Index</title>

          <para>Indexing is automatically handled on VFS layer in completely
          transparent way. In order to agregate metadata to a VFS resource
          using the NIO.2 based API, all you need to do is set a resource
          attributes.</para>

          <important>
            <para>All metadata are stored on dot files alongside its resource.
            So if anything bad happens to your index and it get corrupted, you
            can always recreate the index based on those persistent dot
            files.</para>
          </important>

          <para>The metadata engine is not only for VFS resources, behind the
          scenes there's a powerfull metadata API that you can define your own
          MetaModel with custom MetaTypes, MetaObjects and
          MetaProperties.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Search</title>

          <para>The Metadata Search API is very simple and yet powerful. It
          provides basically two methods, one that allows a full text search
          (including wildcards and boolean operations) or by a set of
          predefined attributes.</para>
        </section>

        <para>For those curious to know what is under the hood, Metadata
        engine uses <link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene
        4</link> as its default backend, but was designed to be able to have
        different and eventually mixed/composed backends.</para>

      <title>Drools Workbench - In depth</title>

      <para>Drools Workbench is the corner stone of the new function and
      features for 6.0.</para>

      <para>Many of the new concepts and functions are described in more
      detail in the following sections.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Remember Drools Workbench is integrated into other
        distributions. Therefore many of the core concepts and functions are
        also within the other distributions. Furthemore jBPM web-based Tooling
        extends from UberFire and re-use features from Drools Workbench that
        are common across the KIE platform; such as Project Explorer, Project
        Editor and the M2 Repository.</para>
      </important>

      <section>
        <title>Home</title>

        <para>Home is where the heart is.</para>

        <para>Drools Workbench starts with a Home Page that will provides
        short-cut navigation to common tasks.</para>

        <para>What is provided in this release is minimal and largely a
        cosmetic exercise to hopefully increase usability for non-technical
        people.</para>

        <para>The appearance and content of the Home is likely to change as we
        approach a final release.</para>

        <title>Project Explorer</title>

        <para>The Project Explorer is where most users will find themselves
        when authoring projects.</para>

        <para>The Project Explorer shows four drop-down selectors that are
        driven by Group, Repository, Project and Package.<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Group : The top level logical entitiy within the KIE
              world. This can represent a Company, Organization, Department
              etc.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Repository : Groups have access to one or more
              repositories. Default repositories are setup; but you can create
              or clone your own.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Project : Repositories contain one or more KIE projects.
              New Projects can be created using the "New" Menu option,
              provided a target repository is selected.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Package : The package concept is no different to Guvnor
              5.5. Projects contain packages.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>Once a Group, Repository, Project and Package are selected the
        Project Explorer shows the items within that context.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>The Project Explorer will support both a Business and
          Technical views. The Technical view will probably not make it into
          6.0.0.Beta4.</para>

        <title>Creating new things</title>

        <para>Creation of anything "new" is accomplished using the "New" menu
        option.</para>

        <para>The types of thing that can be created from the "New" menu
        option depends upon the selected context. Projects require a
        Repository; rules, tests etc require a Package within a Project. New
        things are created in the context selected in the Project Explorer.
        I.E. if Repository 1, Project X is selected new items will be created
        in Project X.</para>

          <para>In import suggestions it is possible to specify a set of

          Because of this these imports differ from what Guvnor 5.x Package
          Editor had, the imports are no longer automatically used in each
          asset, they just make use automated editor in KIE workbench easier
          and suggest fact types that the user might want to use.</para>

        <para>Typically, a business process analyst or data analyst will
        capture the requirements for a process or appliaction and turn these
        into a formal set of data structures and their relationships. The new
        Data Modeller tool enables configuration of such data models (both
        logical and physical), without the need for explicit coding. Its main
        goals are to make data models into first class citizens in the process
        improvement cycle and allow for full process automation using data and
        forms, without the need for advanced development skills.</para>
