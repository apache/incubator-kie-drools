= Other rule action methods from `drools` variable

In addition to the standard rule action methods, the {RULE_ENGINE} supports methods in conjunction with the predefined `drools` variable that you can also use in rule actions.

You can use the `drools` variable to call methods from the `org.kie.api.runtime.rule.RuleContext` class in your {PRODUCT} distribution, which is also the class that the standard rule action methods are based on. For all `drools` rule action options,

download the *{PRODUCT_PAM} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG} Source Distribution* ZIP file from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Red Hat Customer Portal] and navigate to `~/{PRODUCT_FILE}-sources/src/kie-api-parent-$VERSION/kie-api/src/main/java/org/kie/api/runtime/rule/RuleContext.java`.

The `drools` variable contains methods that provide information about the firing rule and the set of facts that activated the firing rule:

* `drools.getRule().getName()`: Returns the name of the currently firing rule.
* `drools.getMatch()`: Returns the `Match` that activated the currently firing rule. It contains information that is useful for logging and debugging purposes, for instance `drools.getMatch().getObjects()` returns the list of objects, enabling rule to fire in the proper tuple order.

From the `drools` variable, you can also obtain a reference to the `KieRuntime` providing useful methods to interact with the running session, for example:

* `drools.getKieRuntime().halt()`: Terminates rule execution if a user or application previously called `fireUntilHalt()`. When a user or application calls `fireUntilHalt()` method, the {RULE_ENGINE} starts in `active` mode and evaluates rules until the user or application explicitly calls `halt()` method. Otherwise, by default, the {RULE_ENGINE} runs in `passive` mode and evaluates rules only when a user or an application explicitly calls `fireAllRules()` method.
* `drools.getKieRuntime().getAgenda()`: Returns a reference to the KIE session `Agenda`, and in turn provides access to rule activation groups, rule agenda groups, and ruleflow groups.

.Example call to access agenda group "CleanUp" and set the focus
[source,java]
----
drools.getKieRuntime().getAgenda().getAgendaGroup( "CleanUp" ).setFocus();
----
+
This example sets the focus to a specified agenda group to which the rule belongs.

* `drools.getKieRuntime().setGlobal()`, `~.getGlobal()`, `~.getGlobals()`: Sets or retrieves global variables.
* `drools.getKieRuntime().getEnvironment()`: Returns the runtime `Environment`, similar to your operating system environment.
* `drools.getKieRuntime().getQueryResults(<string> query)`: Runs a query and returns the results.
