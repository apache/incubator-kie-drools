= Spreadsheet decision tables

Spreadsheet decision tables are XLS or XLSX spreadsheets that contain business rules defined in a tabular format. Each row in a decision table is a rule, and each column is a condition, an action, or another rule attribute. After you create and upload your spreadsheet decision tables, the rules you defined are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules as with all other rule assets.

All data objects related to a spreadsheet decision table must be in the same project package as the spreadsheet decision table. Assets in the same package are imported by default. Existing assets in other packages can be imported with the decision table.
