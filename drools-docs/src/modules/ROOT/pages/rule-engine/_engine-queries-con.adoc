= {RULE_ENGINE} queries and live queries

You can use queries with the {RULE_ENGINE} to retrieve fact sets based on fact patterns as they are used in rules. The patterns might also use optional parameters.

To use queries with the {RULE_ENGINE}, you add the query definitions in DRL files and then obtain the matching results in your application code. While a query iterates over a result collection, you can use any identifier that is bound to the query to access the corresponding fact or fact field by calling the `get()` method with the binding variable name as the argument. If the binding refers to a fact object, you can retrieve the fact handle by calling `getFactHandle()` with the variable name as the parameter.

.Example query definition in a DRL file
[source]
----
query "people under the age of 21"
    $person : Person( age < 21 )
end
----

.Example application code to obtain and iterate over query results
[source,java]
----
QueryResults results = ksession.getQueryResults( "people under the age of 21" );
System.out.println( "we have " + results.size() + " people under the age of 21" );

System.out.println( "These people are under the age of 21:" );

for ( QueryResultsRow row : results ) {
    Person person = ( Person ) row.get( "person" );
    System.out.println( person.getName() + "\n" );
}
----

Invoking queries and processing the results by iterating over the returned set can be difficult when you are monitoring changes over time. To alleviate this difficulty with ongoing queries, {PRODUCT} provides _live queries_, which use an attached listener for change events instead of returning an iterable result set. Live queries remain open by creating a view and publishing change events for the contents of this view.

To activate a live query, start your query with parameters and monitor changes in the resulting view. You can use the `dispose()` method to terminate the query and discontinue this reactive scenario.


.Example query definition in a DRL file
[source]
----
query colors(String $color1, String $color2)
    TShirt(mainColor = $color1, secondColor = $color2, $price: manufactureCost)
end
----

.Example application code with an event listener and a live query
[source,java]
----
final List updated = new ArrayList();
final List removed = new ArrayList();
final List added = new ArrayList();

ViewChangedEventListener listener = new ViewChangedEventListener() {
 public void rowUpdated(Row row) {
  updated.add( row.get( "$price" ) );
 }

 public void rowRemoved(Row row) {
  removed.add( row.get( "$price" ) );
 }

 public void rowAdded(Row row) {
  added.add( row.get( "$price" ) );
 }
};

// Open the live query:
LiveQuery query = ksession.openLiveQuery( "colors",
                                          new Object[] { "red", "blue" },
                                          listener );
...
...

// Terminate the live query:
query.dispose()
