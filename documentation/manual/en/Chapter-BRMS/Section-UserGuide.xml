    <title>Quick start guide</title>

    <para>If you are reading this, you must be the impatient type who wants to
    kick the tyres (and light the fires) and have a look around as soon as
    possible. This section will provide a quick end to end tour of the steps
    involved (but does not go through the concepts in detail). This assumes
    you have installed the repository correctly, and are able to access the
    main login screen.</para>

    tips and examples and even upload files if you desire !).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Initial configuration</title>

      <para>Some initial setup is required the first time. The first time the
      server starts up, it will create an empty repository, then take the
      following steps:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Once deployed, go to "http://&lt;your
          server&gt;/drools-jbrms/" (This will show the initial info screen -
          or login screen depending on the configuration).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If it is a brand new repository, you will want to go to
          "Admin", and choose "Manage Categories"</para>

          <para>(Add a few categories of your choosing, categories are only
          for classification, not for execution or anything else.)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Rules need a fact model (object model) to work off, so next
          you will want to go to the Package management feature. From here you
          can click on the icon to create a new package (give it a meaningful
          name, with no spaces).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>To upload a model, use a jar which has the fact model (API)
          that you will be using in your rules and your code (go and make one
          now if you need to !). When you are in the model editor screen, you
          can upload a jar file, choose the package name from the list that
          you created in the previous step.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Now edit your package configuration (you just created) to
          import the fact types you just uploaded (add import statements), and
          save the changes.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>At this point, the package is configured and ready to go (you
          generally won't have to go through that step very often).</para>

          <para>(Note that you can also import an existing drl package - it
          will store the rules in the repository as individual assets).</para>

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You will also have to choose one category. Categories provide a
          way of viewing rules that is separate to packages (and you can make
          rules appear in multiple packages) - think of it like
          tagging.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>This will open a rule modeler, which is a guided editor. You
          can add and edit conditions and actions based on the model that is
          in use in the current package. Also, any DSL sentence templates
          setup for the package will be available.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>When you are done with rule editing, you can check in the

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You can also add/remove categories from the rule editor, and
          other attributes such as documentation (if you aren't sure what to
          do, write a document in natural language describing the rule, and
          check it in, that can also serve as a template later)</para>

    <section>
      <title>Finding stuff</title>

      <para>In terms of navigating, you can either use the Rules feature,
      which shows things grouped by categories, or you can use the Package
      feature, and view by package (and rule type). If you know the name or
      part of the name of an asset, you can also use the "Quick find", start
      typing a rule name and it will return a list of matches as you type (so
      if you have a sensible naming scheme, it will make it very quick to find
      stuff).</para>

          <para>You can also take a "snapshot" of a package for deployment.
          This freezes the package at that point in time, so any concurrent
          changes to not effect the package. It also makes the package
          available on a URL of the form: "http://&lt;your
          server&gt;/drools-jbrms/org.drools.brms.JBRMS/packages/&lt;packageName&gt;/&lt;snapshotName&gt;"

    <title>BRMS concepts</title>

    <section>
      <title>Rules are assets</title>

      <para>As the BRMS can manage many different types of rules (and more),
      they are all classed as "assets". An asset is anything that can be
      stored as a version in the repository. This includes decision tables,
      models, DSLs and more. Sometimes the word "rule" will be used to really
      mean "asset" (ie the things you can do also apply to the other asset
      types). You can think of asset as a lot like a file in a folder. Assets
      are grouped together for viewing, or to make a package for deployment
      etc.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Categorisation</title>

      <figure>
        <title>Categories</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="CatZoom.png" format="PNG"
                       scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Categories allow rules (assets) to be labeled (or tagged) with
      any number of categories that you define. This means that you can then
      view a list of rules that match a specific category. Rules can belong to
      any number of categories. In the above diagram, you can see this can in
      effect create a folder/explorer like view of assets. The names can be
      anything you want, and are defined by the BRMS administrator (you can
      also remove/add new categories - you can only remove them if they are
      not currently in use).</para>

      <para>Generally categories are created with meaningful name that match
      the area of the business the rule applies to (if the rule applies to
      multiple areas, multiple categories can be attached). Categories can
      also be used to "tag" rules as part of their life-cycle, for example to
      mark as "Draft" or "For Review".</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Assets can have multiple categories</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="CatEdit.png" format="PNG"
                       scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The view above shows the category editor/viewer that is seen when
      you open an asset. In this example you can see the asset belongs to 2
      categories, with a "+" button to add additional items (use the trash can
      item to remove them). This means that when either category is used to
      show a list of assets, you will see that asset.</para>

      <para>In the above example, the first Category "Finance" is a "top
      level" category. The second one: "HR/Awards/QAS" is a still a single
      category, but its a nested category: Categories are hierarchical. This
      means there is a category called "HR", which contains a category
      "Awards" (it will in fact have more sub-categories of course), and
      "Awards" has a sub-category of QAS. The screen shows this as
      "HR/Awards/QAS" - its very much like a folder structure you would have
      on your hard disk (the notable exception is of course that rules can
      appear in multiple places).</para>

      <para>When you open an asset to view or edit, it will show a list of
      categories that it currently belongs to If you make a change (remove or
      add a category) you will need to save the asset - this will create a new
      item in the version history. Changing the categories of a rule has no
      effect on its execution.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Creating categories</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="AdminCats.png" format="PNG"
                       scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The above view shows the administration screen for setting up
      categories (there) are no categories in the system by default. As the
      categories can be hierarchical you chose the "parent" category that you
      want to create a sub-category for. From here categories can also be
      removed (but only if they are not in use by any current versions of
      assets).</para>

      <para>As a general rule, an asset should only belong to 1 or 2
      categories at a time. Categories are critical in cases where you have
      large numbers of rules. The hierarchies do not need to be too deep, but
      should be able to see how this can help you break down rules/assets into
      manageable chunks. Its ok if its not clear at first, you are free to
      change categories as you go.</para>

      <para>The above diagram shows the "asset editor" with some annotated

          <para>A</para>

          <para>This is where the "editor widget" lives - exactly what form

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>B</para>

          <para>This is the documentation area - a free text area where
          descriptions of the rule can live. It is encouraged to write a plain
          description in the rule here before editing.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>C</para>

          <para>These are the actions - for saving, archiving, changing status

      <title>Rule authoring</title>

      <para>The BRMS supports a (growing) list of formats of assets (rules).
      Here the key ones are described. Some of these are covered in other
      parts of the manual, and the detail will not be repeated here.</para>

        <title>Business rules with the guided editor</title>

        <para>Guided editor style "Business rules": (also known as "BRL
        format"). These rules use the guided GUI which controls and propts
        user input based on knowledge of the object model. This can also be
        augmented with DSL sentences.</para>

        <para>IMPORTANT: to use the BRL guided editor, someone will need to
        have you package configured before hand.</para>

        <para>Also note that there is a guided editor in the Eclipse plug in,
        most of the details in this section can also apply to it.</para>

          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>The above diagram shows the editor in action. The following
        description apply to the letter boxes in the diagram above:</para>

        <para>A: The different parts of a rule. The "WHEN" part is the
        condition, "THEN" action, and "(options)" are optional attributes that
        may effect the operation of the rule.</para>

        <para>B: This shows a pattern which is declaring that the rule is
        looking for a "Driver" fact (the fields are listed below, in this case
        just "age"). Note the green triangle, it will popup a list of options
        to add to the fact declaration: you can add more fields (eg their
        "location"), or you can assign a variable name to the fact (which you
        can use later on if needs be). As well as adding more fields to this
        pattern - you can add "multiple field" constraints - ie constraints
        that span across fields (eg age &gt; 42 or risk &gt; 2). The popup
        dialog shows the options.</para>

        <para>C: The small "-" icons indicate you can remove something - in
        this case it would remove the whole Driver fact declaration. If its
        the one below, it would remove just the age constraint.</para>

        <para>D: The "+" symbols allow you to add more patterns to the
        condition or the action part of the rule, or more attributes. In all
        cases, a popup option box is provided. For the "WHEN" part of the
        rule, you can choose to add a constraint on a fact (it will give you a
        list of facts), or you can use another conditional element, the
        choices which are : "There is no" - which means the fact+constraints
        must not exist, "There exists" - which means that there exists at
        least one match (but there only needs to be one - it will not trigger
        for each match), and "Any of" - which means that any of the patterns
        can match (you then add patterns to these higher level patterns). If
        you just put a fact (like is shown above) then all the patterns are
        combined together so they are all true ("and").</para>

        <para>E: This shows the constraint for the "age" field. (Looking from
        left to right) the green triangle allows you to "assign" a variable
        name to the "age" field, which you may use later on in the rule. Next
        is the list of constraint operations - this list changes depending on
        the data type. After that is the value field - the value field will be
        one of: a) a literal value (eg number, text), b) a "formula" - in
        which case it is an expression which is calculated (this is for
        advanced users) or b) a variable (in which case a list will be
        provided to choose values from). After this there is a horizontal
        arrow icon, this is for "connective constraints" : these are
        constraints which allow you to have alternative values to check a
        field against, for example: "age is less than 42 or age is not equal
        to 39" is possibly this way.</para>

        <para>F: This shows an "action" of the rule, a rule consists of a list
        of actions. In this case, we are asserting/inserting a new fact, which
        is a rejection (with the "reason" field set to an explanation). There
        are quite a few other types of actions you can use: you can modify an
        existing fact (which tells the engine the fact has changed) - or you
        can simply set a field on a fact (in which case the engine doesn't
        know about the change - normally because you are setting a result).
        You can also retract a fact. In most cases the green arrow will give
        you a list of fields you can add so you can change the value. The
        values you enter are "literal" - in the sense that what you type is
        what the value is. If it needs to be a calculation, then add an "=" at
        the start of the value - this will be interpreted as a "formula" (for
        advanced users only) ! and the calculation will be performed (not
        unlike a spreadsheet).</para>

        <para>G: This is where the rule options live. In this case, only
        salience is used which is a numeric value representing the rules
        "priority". This would probably be the most common option to
        use.</para>

	<para>
	  Note that is it possible to limit field values to items in a pre configured list. This list is configured as part of the package (using a data enumeration to provide values for the drop down list). These values can be a fixed list, or (for example) loaded from a database. This is useful for codes, and other fields where there are set values. It is also possible to have what is displayed on screen, in a drop down, be different to the value (or code) used in a rule. See the section on data enumerations for how these are configured.

        <para>Augmenting with DSL sentences: If the package the rule is part
        of has a dsl configuration, when when you add conditions or actions,
        then it will provide a list of "DSL Sentences" which you can choose
        from - when you choose one, it will add a row to the rule - where the
        DSL specifies values come from a user, then a edit box (text) will be
        shown (so it ends up looking a bit like a form). This is optional, and
        there is another DSL editor. Please note that the DSL capabilities in
        this editor are slightly less then the full set of DSL features
        (basically you can do [when] and [then] sections of the DSL only -
        which is no different to drools 3 in effect).</para>

        <para>The following diagram shows the DSL sentences in action in the
        guided editor:</para>

        </figure>

        <para>In the above example, you can see it is using a mixture of
        literal values, and formulas. The second constraint on the "Person"
        fact, is a formula (in this case it is doing a silly calculation on
        the persons age, and checking something against their name - both
        "age" and "name" are fields of the Person fact in this case. In the
        3rd line (which says "age is less than .." - it is also using a
        formula, although, in this case the formula does a calculation and
        returns a value (which is used in the comparison) - in the former
        case, it had to return True or False (in this case, its a value).
        Obvious formulas are basically pieces of code - so this is for
        experienced users only.</para>

        <para>Looking at the "Board" pattern (the second pattern with the
        horizontal grey bar): this uses a top level conditional element
        ("There is no") - this means that the pattern is actually looking for
        the "non existence" of a fact that matches the pattern. Note the "Any
        of:" - this means that EITHER the "type" field constraint is matched,
        or the "name" field is matched (to "myname" in the case above). This
        is what is termed a Multiple field constraint (you can nest these, and
        have it as complex as you like, depending on how much you want the
        next person to hate you: Some paraphrased advice: Write your rules in
        such as way as the person who has to read/maintain them is a
        psychopath, has a gun, and knows where you live).</para>

        <para>The above dialog is what you will get when you want to add
        constraints to the Person fact. In the top half are the simple
        options: you can either add a field straight away (a list of fields of
        the Person fact will be shown), or you can add a "Multiple field
        constraint" - of a given type (which is described above). The Advanced
        options: you can add a formula (which resolves to True or False - this
        is like in the example above: "age &lt; (age * 2) ...."). You can also
        assign a Variable name to the Person fact (which means you can then
        access that variable on the action part of the rule, to set a value
        etc).</para>

        <title>DSL rules</title>

        <para>DSL rules are textual rules, that use a language configuration
        asset to control how they appear.</para>

        <para>A dsl rule is a single rule. Referring to the picture above, you
        can a text editor. You can use the icons to the right to provide lists
        of conditions and actions to choose from (or else press Control +
        Space at the same time to pop up a list).</para>

        <title>Spreadsheet decision tables</title>

        <para>Multiple rules can be stored in a spreadsheet (each row is a
        rule). The details of the spreadsheet are not covered in this chapter
        (as there is a separate chapter for them).</para>

        </figure>

        <para>To use a spreadsheet, you upload an xls (and can download the
        current version, as per the picture above). To create a new decision
        table, when you launch the rule wizard, you will get an option to
        create one (after that point, you can upload the xls file).</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Rule flows</title>

        <para>Rule flows: Rule flows allow you to visually describe the steps
        taken - so not all rules are evaluated at once, but there is a flow of
        logic. Rule flows are not covered in this chapter on the BRMS, but you
        can use the IDE to graphically draw ruleflows, and upload the .rf file
        to the BRMS.</para>

        <para>Similar to spreadsheets, you upload/download ruleflow files (the
        eclipse IDE has a graphical editor for them). The details of Rule
        Flows are not discussed here.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Technical rules (drl)</title>

        <para>Technical (drl) rules are stored as text - they can be managed
        in the BRMS. A DRL can either be a whole chunk of rules, or an
        individual rule. if its an individual rule, no package statement or
        imports are required (in fact, you can skip the "rule" statement
        altogether, just use "when" and "then" to mark the condition and
        action sections respectively). Normally you would use the IDE to edit
        raw DRL files, since it has all the advanced tooling and content
        assistance and debugging, however there are times when a rule may have
        to deal with something fairly technical. In any typical package of
        rules, you generally have a been for some "technical rules" - you can
        mix and match all the rule types together of course.</para>

        <title>Data enumerations (drop down list configurations)</title>

        <para>Data enumerations are an optional asset type that technical folk can configure to provide drop down lists for the guided editor. These are stored and edited just like any other asset, and apply to the package that they belong to.</para>

	<para>
	  The contents of an enum config are a mapping of Fact.field to a list of values to be used in a drop down. That list can either be literal, or use a utility class (which you put on the classpath) to load a list of strings. The strings are either a value to be shown on a drop down, or a mapping from the code value (what ends up used in the rule) and a display value (see the example below, using the '=').
	</para>

      <para>
	In the above diagram - the "MM" indicates a value that will be used in the rule, yet "Mini Mal" will be displayed in the GUI. 
      </para>

      <para>
	Getting data lists from external data sources: It is possible to have the BRMS call a piece of code which will load a list of Strings. To do this, you will need a bit of code that returns a java.util.List (of String's) to be on the classpath of the BRMS. Instead of specifying a list of values in the BRMS itself - the code can return the list of Strings (you can use the "=" inside the strings if you want to use a different display value to the rule value, as normal). 
For example, in the 'Person.age' line above, you could change it to:
<programlisting>
  'Person.age' : (new com.yourco.DataHelper()).getListOfAges()
</programlisting>
This assumes you have a class called "DataHelper" which has a method "getListOfAges()" which returns a List of strings (and is on the classpath). You can of course mix these "dynamic" enumerations with fixed lists. You could for example load from a database using JDBC.
The data enumerations are loaded the first time you use the guided editor in a session. If you have any guided editor sessions open - you will need to close and then open the rule to see the change. 
To check the enumeration is loaded - if you go to the Package configuration screen, you can "save and validate" the package - this will check it and provide any error feedback.
      </para>

    <section><title>Templates of assets/rules</title>

          <para>Tip: As you may have many similar rules, you can create rule
      templates, which are simply rules which are kept in an inactive package
      - you can then categories templates accordingly, and copy them as needed
      (choosing a live package as the target package).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Status management</title>

      <para>Each asset (and also package) in the BRMS has a status flag set.
      The values of the status flag are set in the Administration section of
      the BRMS. (you can add your own status names). Similar to Categories,
      Statuses do NOT effect the execution in any way, and are purely
      informational. Unlike categories, assets only have one status AT A
      TIME.</para>

      <para>Using statuses is completely optional. You can use it to manage
      the lifecycle of assets (which you can alternatively do with categories
      if you like).</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Asset status</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>You can change the status of an individual asset (like in the
      diagram above). Its change takes effect immediately, no separate save is
      needed.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Asset status</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>You can change the status of a whole package - this sets the
      status flag on the package itself, but it ALSO changes the statuses on
      ALL the assets that belong to this package in one hit (to be the same as
      what you set the package to).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Package management</title>

      <para>Configuring packages is generally something that is done once, and
      by someone with some experience with rules/models. Generally speaking,
      very few people will need to configure packages, and once they are
      setup, they can be copied over and over if needed. Package configuration
      is most definitely a technical task that requires the appropriate
      expertise.</para>

      <para>All assets live in "packages" in the BRMS - a package is like a
      folder (it also serves as a "namespace"). A home folder for rule assets
      to live in. Rules in particular need to know what the fact model is,
      what the namespace is etc.</para>

      <para><figure>
          <title>The package explorer</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata align="center" fileref="PackageExplorer.png"
                         format="PNG" scalefit="1" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>The above picture shows the package explorer. Clicking on an
      asset type will show a list of matches (for packages with thousands of
      rules, showing the list may take several seconds - hence the importance
      of using categories to help you find your way around).</para>

      <para>So whilst rules (and assets in general) can appear in any number
      of categories, they only live in one package. If you think of the BRMS
      as a file system, then each package is a folder, and the assets live in
      that folder - as one big happy list of files. When you create a
      deployment snapshot of a package, you are effectively copying all the
      assets in that "folder" into another special "folder".</para>

      <para>The package management feature allows you to see a list of
      packages, and then "expand" them, to show lists of each "type" of asset
      (there are many assets, so some of them are grouped together):</para>

      <para>The asset types: <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Business assets: this shows a list of all "business rule"
            types, which include decision tables, business rules etc.
            etc.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Functions: In the BRMS you can also have functions defined

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>DSL: Domain Specific Languages can also be stored as an
            asset. If they exist (generally there is only one), then they will
            be used in the appropriate editor GUIs.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Model: A package requires at least one model - for the

      you hover the mouse over them, a tooltip will tell you what they

        </figure>One of the most critical things you need to do is configure
      packages. This is mostly importing the classes used by the rules, and
      globals variables. Once you make a change, you need to save it, and that
      package is then configured and ready to be built. For example, you may
      add a model which has a class called "com.something.Hello", you would
      then add "import com.something.Hello" in your package configuration and
      save the change.</para>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>Finally you would "build" a package. Any errors caught are
      then shown at this point. If the build was successful, then you will
      have the option to create a snapshot for deployment. You can also view
      the "drl" that this package results in. WARNING: in cases of large
      numbers of rules, all these operations can take some time.</para>

      <para>It is optional at this stage to enter the name of a "selector" - see the admin section for details on how to configure custom selectors for your system (if you need them - selecters allow you to filter down what you build into a package - if you don't know what they are for, you probably don't need to use them).</para>

      <section>
        <title>Importing drl packages</title>

        <para>It is also possible to create a package by importing an existing
        "drl" file. When you choose to create a new package, you can choose an
        option to upload a .drl file. The BRMS will then attempt to understand
        that drl, break create a package for you. The rules in it will be
        stored as individual assets (but still as drl text content). Note that
        to actually build the package, you will need to upload an appropriate
        model (as a jar) to validate against, as a separate step.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Version management</title>

      <para>Both assets and whole packages of assets are "versioned" in the
      BRMS, but the mechanism is slightly different. Individual assets are
      saved a bit like a version of a file in a source control system.
      However, packages of assets are versioned "on demand" by taking a
      snapshot (typically which is used for deployment). The next section
      talks about deployment management and snapshots.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Asset versions</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="AssetVersionHistory.png"

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Each time you make a change to an asset, it creates a new item in
      the version history. This is a bit like having an unlimited undo. You
      can look back through the history of an individual asset like the list
      above, and view it (and restore it) from that point in time.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Deployment management</title>

      <para>Snapshots, URLS and binary packages:</para>

      <para>URLs are central to how built packages are provided. The BRMS
      provides packages via URLs (for download and use by the Rule Agent).
      These URLs take the form of:
      http://&lt;server&gt;/drools-jbrms/org.drools.brms.JBRMS/package/&lt;packageName&gt;/&lt;packageVersion&gt;</para>

      <para>&lt;packageName&gt; is the name you gave the package.
      &lt;packageVersion&gt; is either the name of a snapshot, or "LATEST" (if
      its LATEST, then it will be the latest built version from the main
      package, not a snapshot). You can use these in the agent, or you can
      paste them into your browser and it will download them as a file.</para>

      <para>Refer to the section on the Rule Agent for details on how you can
      use these URLs (and binary downloads) in your application, and how rules
      can be updated on the fly.</para>

      <para>The above shows deployment snapshots view. On the left there is a
      list of packages. Clicking on a specific package will show you a list
      of snapshots for that package (if any). From there you can copy, remove
      or view an asset snapshot. Each snapshot is available for download or
      access via a URL for deployment.</para>

      <title>Navigating and finding rules</title>

      <para>The two main ways of viewing the repository are by using
      user-driven Categorization (tagging) as outlined above, and the package
      explorer view.</para>

      <para>The category view provides a way to navigate your rules in a way
      that makes sense to your organization.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Category view</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="CategoryExplorer.png"
                       format="PNG" scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The above diagram shows categories in action. Generally under each
      category you should have no more then a few dozen rules, if
      possible.</para>

      <para>The alternative and more technical view is to use the package
      explorer. This shows the rules (assets) closer to how they are actually
      stored in the database, and also separates rules into packages (name
      spaces) and their type (format, as rules can be in many different
      formats).</para>

      <figure>

      <para>The above shows the alternate way of exploring - using
      packages.</para>

    <title>The business user perspective</title>

    <para>You can see from this manual, that some expertise and practice is
    required to use the BRMS. In fact any software system in some sense
    requires that people be "technical" even if it has a nice looking GUI.
    Having said that, in the right hands the BRMS can be setup to provide a
    suitable environment for non technical users.</para>

    <para>The most appropriate rule formats for this use are using the Guided
    editor, Decision tables and DSL rules. You can use some DSL expressions
    also in the guided editor (so it provides "forms" for people to enter
    values).</para>

    <para>You can use categories to isolate rules and assets from non
    technical users. Only assets which have a category assigned will appear in
    the "rules" feature.</para>

    <para>The initial setup of the BRMS will need to be done by a
    developer/technical person who will set the foundations for all the rules.
    They may also create "templates" which are rules which may be copied (they
    would typically live in a "dummy" package, and have a category of
    "template" - this can also help ease the way).</para>

    <para>Deployment should also not be done by non technical users (as
    mentioned previously this happens from the "Package" feature).</para>

  <section>
    <title>Deployment: Integrating rules with your applications</title>

    <para>Its all very interesting to manage rules, but how to you use or
    "consume" them in your application? This section covers the usage of the
    RuleAgent deployment component that automates most of this for you.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The Rule Agent</title>

      <para>The rule agent is a component which is embedded in the core
      runtime of the rules engine. To use this, you don't need any extra
      components. In fact, if you are using the BRMS, your application should
      only need to include the drools-core.jar in its classpath, and no other
      rules specific dependencies.</para>

      <para>Once you have "built" your rules in a package in the BRMS, you are
      ready to use the agent in your target application.</para>

      <para>To use the rule agent, you will use a call in your applications
      code like:</para>

      <programlisting>RuleAgent agent = RuleAgent.newRuleAgent("/MyRules.properties");     
RuleBase rb = agent.getRuleBase(); 
rb.newStatefulSession.... 
//now assert your facts into the session and away you go !
</programlisting>

      <para>IMPORTANT: You should only have one instance of the RuleAgent per
      rulebase you are using. This means you should (for example) keep the
      RuleBase in JNDI (or similar).</para>

      <para>This assumes that there is a MyRules.properties in the root of
      your classpath. You can also pass in a Properties object with the
      parameters set up (the parameters are discussed next).</para>

      <para>The following shows the content of MyRules.properties:</para>

      <programlisting>##
## RuleAgent configuration file example
##

newInstance=true
file=/foo/bar/boo.pkg /foo/bar/boo2.pkg
dir=/my/dir
url=http://some.url/here http://some.url/here
localCacheDir=/foo/bar/cache
poll=30


name=MyConfig</programlisting>

      <para>You can only have one type of key in each configuration (eg only
      one "file", "dir" etc - even though you can specify multiple items by
      space separating them). Note also, instead of a discrete properties
      file, you can construct a java.utils.Properties object, and pass it in
      to the RuleBase methods.</para>

      <para>Referring to the above example, the "keys" in the properties
      are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>newInstance</para>

          <para>Setting this to "true" means that the RuleBase instance will
          be created fresh each time there is a change. this means you need to
          do agent.getRuleBase() to get the new updated rulebase (any existing
          ones in use will be untouched). The default is false, which means
          rulebases are updated "in place" - ie you don't need to keep calling
          getRuleBase() to make sure you have the latest rules (also any
          StatefulSessions will be updated automatically with rule
          changes).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>file</para>

          <para>This is a space-separated list of files - each file is a
          binary package as exported by the BRMS. You can have one or many.
          The name of the file is not important. Each package must be in its
          own file.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>dir</para>

          <para>This is similar to file, except that instead of specifying a
          list of files you specify a directory, and it will pick up all the
          files in there (each one is a package) and add them to the rulebase.
          Each package must be in its own file.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>url</para>

          <para>This is a space separated list of URLs to the BRMS which is
          exposing the packages (see below for more details).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>localCacheDir</para>

          <para>This is used in conjunction with the url above, so that if the
          BRMS is down (the url is not accessible) then if the runtime has to
          start up, it can start up with the last known "good" versions of the
          packages.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>poll</para>

          <para>This is set to the number of seconds to check for changes to
          the resources (a timer is used).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>name</para>

          <para>This is used to specify the name of the agent which is used
          when logging events (as typically you would have multiple agents in
          a system).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Following shows the deployment screen of the BRMS, which provides
      URLs and downloads of packages.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Snapshot deployment</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="SnapshotDeploy.png"
                       format="PNG" scalefit="1" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>You can see the "Package URI" - this is the URL that you would
      copy and paste into the agent .properties file to specify that you want
      this package. It specifies an exact version (in this case to a snapshot)
      - each snapshot has its own URL. If you want the "latest" - then replace
      "NewSnapshot" with "LATEST".</para>

      <para>You can also download a .pkg file from here, which you can drop in
      a directory and use the "file" or "dir" feature of the RuleAgent if
      needed (in some cases people will not want to have the runtime
      automatically contact the BRMS for updates - but that is generally the
      easiest way for many people).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Manual deployment</title>

      <para>This section is only needed for advanced users who are integrating
      deployment into their own mechanism. Normally you should use the rule
      agent.</para>

      <para>For those who do not wish to use the automatic deployment of the
      RuleAgent, "rolling your own" is quite simple. The binary packages
      emitted by the BRMS are serialized Package objects. You can deserialize
      them and add them into any rulebase - essentially that is all you need
      to do.</para>

      <para>From the BRMS, binary packages are provided either from the latest
      version of a package (once you have successfully validated and built a
      package) or from the deployment snapshots. The URLs that the BRMS web
      application exposes provide the binary package via http. You can also
      issue a "HEAD" command to get the last time a package was
      updated.</para>
