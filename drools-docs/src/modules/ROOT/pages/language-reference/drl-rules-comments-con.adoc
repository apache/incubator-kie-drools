= Comments in DRL files

DRL supports single-line comments prefixed with a double forward slash `//` and multi-line comments enclosed with a forward slash and asterisk `/* ... */`. You can use DRL comments to annotate rules or any related components in DRL files. DRL comments are ignored by the {RULE_ENGINE} when the DRL file is processed.

.Example rule with comments

----
rule "Underage"
  // This is a single-line comment.
  when
    $application : LoanApplication()  // This is an in-line comment.
    Applicant( age < 21 )
  then
    /* This is a multi-line comment
    in the rule actions. */
    $application.setApproved( false );
    $application.setExplanation( "Underage" );
end
