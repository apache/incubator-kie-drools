  <title>Complex Event Processing</title>

  <para>Although several tries were made, there isn't up to date any broadly
  accepted definition on the term &lt;indexterm&gt;&lt;primary&gt;Complex
  Event Processing&lt;/primary&gt;&lt;/indexterm&gt;. The term
  &lt;indexterm&gt;&lt;primary&gt;Event&lt;/primary&gt;&lt;/indexterm&gt; by
  itself is frequently overloaded and used to refer to several different
  things, depending on the context it is used. Defining terms is not the goal
  of this guide and as so, lets adopt a loose definition that, although not
  formal, will allow us to proceed with a common understanding. </para>

  <important>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Event</emphasis>, in the scope of this guide,
    is a record of a significant change of state. For instance, on a Stock
    Broker application, when a sell operation is executed, it causes a change
    of state in the domain. This change of state can be observed on several
    entities in the domain, like the price of the securities that changed to
    match the value of the operation, the owner of the individual traded
    assets that change from the seller to the buyer, the balance of the
    accounts from both seller and buyer that are credited and debited, etc.
    Depending on how the domain is modelled, this change of state may be
    represented by a single event, multiple atomic events or even hierarchies
    of correlated events. In any case, in the context of this guide, Event is
    the record of the change on a particular data in the domain.</para>
  </important>

  <para>Events are processed by computer systems since they were invented, and
  throughout the history, systems responsible for that were given different
  names and different methodologies were employed. It wasn't until the 90's
  though, that a more focused work started on EDA (Event Driven Architecture)
  with a more formal definition on the requirements and goals for event
  processing. Old messaging systems started to change to address such
  requirements and new systems started to be developed with the single purpose
  of event processing. Two trends were born under the names of Event Stream
  Processing and Complex Event Processing.</para>

  <para>In the very begginings, Event Stream Processing was focused on the
  capabilities of processing streams of events in (near) real time, where the
  main focus of Complex Event Processing was on the correlation and
  composition of atomic events into complex (compound) events. An important
  (maybe the most important) milestone was the publishing of the Dr. David
  Luckham's book "The Power of Events" in 2002. In the book, Dr Luckham
  introduces the concept of Complex Event Processing and how it can be used to
  enhance systems that deal with events. Over the years, both trends converged
  to a common understanding and today these systems are all refered as CEP
  systems.</para>

  <para>This is a very simplistic explanation to a really complex and fertile
  field of research, but sets a very highlevel and common understanding for
  the concepts this guide will introduce.</para>

  <para>Wikipedia defines Complex Event Processing as:</para>

  <blockquote>
    <para>"Complex Event Processing, or CEP, is primarily an event processing
    concept that deals with the task of processing multiple events with the
    goal of identifying the meaningful events within the event cloud. CEP
    employs techniques such as detection of complex patterns of many events,
    event correlation and abstraction, event hierarchies, and relationships
    between events such as causality, membership, and timing, and event-driven
    processes."</para>
