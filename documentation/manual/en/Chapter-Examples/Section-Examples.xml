  <title>Getting the examples</title>

  <para>Make sure the Drools Eclipse plugin is installed, which needs GEF
  dependency installed first. Then download and extract the drools-examples
  zip file, which includes an already created Eclipse project. Import that
  project into a new Eclipse workspace. The rules all have example classes
  that execute the rules. If you want to try the examples in another project
  (or another IDE) then you will need to setup the dependencies by hand of
  course. Many, but not all of the examples are documented below, enjoy

    <title>Hello World</title>

    <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">Name:</emphasis> Hello World
<emphasis role="bold">Main class:</emphasis> org.drools.examples.HelloWorldExample
<emphasis role="bold">Type:</emphasis> java application
<emphasis role="bold">Rules file:</emphasis> HelloWorld.drl
<emphasis role="bold">Objective:</emphasis> demonstrate basic rules in use
</programlisting>

    <para>The "Hello World" example shows a simple example of rules usage, and
    both the MVEL and Java dialects.</para>

    <para>In this example it will be shown how to build rulebases and sessions
    and how to add audit logging and debug outputs, this information is
    ommitted from other examples as it's all very similar. PackageBuilder is
    used to turn a drl source file into Package objects which the RuleBase can
    consume, addPackageFromDrl takes a Reader interface as the parameter.
    Reader can be used to retrieve a source drl file from various locations,
    in this case the drl file is being retrieved from the classpath as an
    InputStream which we turn into a Reader by wrapping it with
    InputStreamReader; but it could come the disk or a url. The use of the
    Reader interface means that Drools does not have to care. In this case we
    only add a single drl source file, but multiple drl files can be added and
    all are merged into a single Package. All drl files added to the
    PackageBuilder must declare themselves in the same package namespace, if
    you wish to build a Package in a different namespace a new instance of
    PackageBuilder must be created; multiple packages of differerent
    namespaces can be added to the same RuleBase. When all the drl files have
    been added we should check the builder for errors; while the RuleBase will
    validate the packge it will only have access to the error information as a
    String, so if you wish to debug the error information you should do it on
    the builder instance. Once we know the builder is error free get the
    Package, instantiate a RuleBase from the RuleBaseFactory and add the
    package.</para>

    <example>
      <title>HelloWorld example: Creating the RuleBase and Session</title>

      <programlisting>//read in the source
Reader source = new InputStreamReader( HelloWorldExample.class.getResourceAsStream( "HelloWorld.drl" ) );

PackageBuilder builder = new PackageBuilder();

//this wil parse and compile in one step
builder.addPackageFromDrl( source );

// Check the builder for errors
if ( builder.hasErrors() ) {
    System.out.println( builder.getErrors().toString() );
    throw new RuntimeException( "Unable to compile \"HelloWorld.drl\".");
}

//get the compiled package (which is serializable)
Package pkg = builder.getPackage();

//add the package to a rulebase (deploy the rule package).
RuleBase ruleBase = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase();
ruleBase.addPackage( pkg );

StatefulSession session = ruleBase.newStatefulSession();</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Drools has an event model that exposes much of whats happening
    internally, two default debug listeners are supplied
    DebugAgendaEventListener and DebugWorkingMemoryEventListener which print
    out debug event information to the err console, adding listeners to a
    session is trivial and shown below. The WorkingMemoryFileLogger provides
    execution auditing which can be viewed in a graphical viewer; it's
    actually a specialised implementation built on the agenda and working
    memory listeners, when the engine has finished executing
    logger.writeToDisk() must be called.</para>

    <para>Most of the examples use the Audit logging features of Drools to
    record execution flow for later inspection.</para>

    <example>
      <title>HelloWorld example: Event logging and Auditing</title>

      <programlisting>// setup the debug listeners
session.addEventListener( new DebugAgendaEventListener() );
session.addEventListener( new DebugWorkingMemoryEventListener() );
        
// setup the audit logging
WorkingMemoryFileLogger logger = new WorkingMemoryFileLogger( session );
logger.setFileName( "log/helloworld" );     </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The single class used in this example is very simple, it has two
    fields: the message, which is a String and the status which can be either
    the int HELLO or the int GOODBYE.</para>

    <example>
      <title>HelloWorld example: Message Class</title>

      <programlisting>public static class Message {
    public static final int HELLO   = 0;
    public static final int GOODBYE = 1;

    private String          message;
    private int             status; 
    ...
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>A single Message object is created with the message "Hello World"
    and status HELLO and then inserted into the engine, at which point
    fireAllRules() is executed. Remember all the network evaluation is done
    during the insert time, by the time the program execution reaches the
    fireAllRules() method it already knows which rules are fully matches and
    able to fire.</para>

    <example>
      <title>HelloWorld example: Execution</title>

      <programlisting>Message message = new Message();
message.setMessage( "Hello World" );
message.setStatus( Message.HELLO );
session.insert( message );
        
session.fireAllRules();
        
logger.writeToDisk();
      
session.dispose();    </programlisting>
    </example>

      </orderedlist></para>

    <para>If we put a breakpoint on the fireAllRules() method and select the
    session variable we can see that the "Hello World" view is already
    activated and on the Agenda, showing that all the pattern matching work
    was already done during the insert.</para>

[AfterActivationFired(4): rule=Good Bye]  </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">LHS (when)</emphasis> section of the rule
    states that it will be activated for each <emphasis>Message</emphasis>
    object inserted into the working memory whose <emphasis>status</emphasis>
    is <emphasis>Message.HELLO</emphasis>. Besides that, two variable binds
    are created: "<emphasis>message</emphasis>" variable is bound to the
    <emphasis>message</emphasis> attribute and "<emphasis>m</emphasis>"
    variable is bound to the <emphasis>object matched pattern</emphasis>
    itself.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">RHS (consequence, then)</emphasis> section
    of the rule is written using the MVEL expression language, as declared by
    the rule's attribute <emphasis>dialect</emphasis>. After printing the
    content of the <emphasis>message</emphasis> bound variable to the default
    console, the rule changes the values of the <emphasis>message</emphasis>
    and <emphasis>status</emphasis> attributes of the <emphasis>m</emphasis>
    bound variable; using MVEL's 'modify' keyword which allows you to apply a
    block of setters in one statement, with the engine being automatically
    notified of the changes at the end of the block.</para>

    <example>
      <title>HelloWorld example: rule "Hello World"</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Hello World"
      dialect "mvel"
  when
      m : Message( status == Message.HELLO, message : message )
  then
      System.out.println( message ); 
      modify ( m ) { message = "Goodbyte cruel world",
                     status = Message.GOODBYE };
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>We can add a break point into the DRL for when modify is called
    during the execution of the "Hello World" consequence and inspect the
    Agenda view again. Notice this time we "Debug As" a "Drools application"
    and not a "Java application".</para>

    <para><orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Open the class org.drools.examples.FibonacciExample in your

          application"</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>Now we can see that the other rule "Good Bye" which uses
    the java dialect is activated and placed on the agenda.</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Hello World : rule "Hello World" Agenda View</title>

      <mediaobject>

          <imagedata fileref="helloworld_agenda2.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The "Good Bye" rule is similar to the "Hello World" rule but matches
    Message objects whose status is Message.GOODBYE instead, printing its
    message to the default console, it specifies the "java" dialect.</para>

    <example>
      <title>HelloWorld example: rule "Good Bye"</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Good Bye"
      dialect "java"
  when
      Message( status == Message.GOODBYE, message : message )
  then
      System.out.println( message ); 
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>If you remember at the start of this example in the java code we
    created a WorkingMemoryFileLogger and called logger.writeToDisk() at the
    end, this created an audit log file that can be shown in the Audit view.
    We use the audit view in many of the examples to try and understand the
    example execution flow. In the view below we can see the object is
    inserted which creates an activation for the "Hello World" rule, the
    activation is then executed which updated the Message object causing the
    "Good Bye" rule to activate, the "Good Bye" rule then also executes. When
    an event in the Audit view is select it highlights the origin event in
    green, so below the Activation created event is highlighted in greed as
    the origin of the Activation executed event.</para>

    <title>State Example</title>

    <para>This example is actually implemented in three different versions to
    demonstrate different ways of implementing the same basic behavior: rules
    forward chaining, i.e., the ability the engine has to evaluate, activate
    and fire rules in sequence, based on changes on the facts in the working
    memory.</para>

<emphasis role="bold">Rules file:</emphasis> StateExampleUsingSalience.drl
<emphasis role="bold">Objective:</emphasis> Demonstrates basic rule use and Conflict Resolution for rule firing priority.</programlisting>Each
      State class has fields for its name and its current state (see
      org.drools.examples.State class). The two possible states for each
      objects are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>NOTRUN</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>FINISHED</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <example>
        <title>State Classs</title>

        <programlisting>public class State {
    public static final int       NOTRUN   = 0;
    public static final int       FINISHED = 1;

    private final PropertyChangeSupport changes  = new PropertyChangeSupport( this );

    private int                   state;

    ... setters and getters go here...
}</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>Ignore the PropertyChangeSupport for now, that will be explained
      later. In the example we create four State objects with names: A, B, C
      and D. Initially all are set to state NOTRUN, which is default for the
      used constructor. Each instance is asserted in turn into the session and
      then fireAllRules() is called.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Salience State Example Execution</title>

        <programlisting>State a = new State( "A" );
State b = new State( "B" );
State c = new State( "C" );
final State d = new State( "D" );

// By setting dynamic to TRUE, Drools will use JavaBean
// PropertyChangeListeners so you don't have to call update().
boolean dynamic = true;

session.insert( a,
                dynamic );
session.insert( b,
                dynamic );
session.insert( c,
                dynamic );
session.insert( d,
                dynamic );

session.fireAllRules();
session.dispose(); // Stateful rule session must always be disposed when finished</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>To execute the application:</para>

      <para><orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Open the class org.drools.examples.StateExampleUsingSalience
            in your Eclipse IDE</para>

            application"</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist></para>

      <para>And you will see the following output in the Eclipse console
      output:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Salience State Example Console Output</title>

        <programlisting>A finished
B finished
C finished
D finished
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>There are four rules in total, first a Bootstrap rule fires
      setting A to state FINISHED which then causes B to change to state
      FINISHED. C and D are both dependent on B - causing a conflict which is
      resolved by setting salience values. First lets look at how this was
      executed</para>

      <para>The best way to understand what is happening is to use the "Audit
      Log" feature to graphically see the results of each operation. The Audit
      log was generated when the example was previously run. To view the Audit
      log in Eclipse:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If the "Audit View" is not visible, click on:
          "Window"-&gt;"Show View"-&gt;"Other..."-&gt;"Drools"-&gt;"Audit
          View"</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>In the "Audit View" click in the "Open Log" button and select
          the file "&lt;drools-examples-drl-dir&gt;/log/state.log"</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>After that, the "Audit view" will look like the following
      screenshot.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Salience State Example Audit View</title>

        <mediaobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Reading the log in the "Audit View", top to down, we see every
      action and the corresponding changes in the working memory. This way we
      see that the assertion of the State "A" object with the "NOTRUN" state
      activates the "Bootstrap" rule, while the assertions of the other state
      objects have no immediate effect.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Salience State Example: Rule "Bootstrap"</title>

        <programlisting>rule Bootstrap
    when
        a : State(name == "A", state == State.NOTRUN )
    then
        System.out.println(a.getName() + " finished" );
        a.setState( State.FINISHED );
end</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The execution of "Bootstrap" rule changes the state of "A" to
      "FINISHED", that in turn activates the "A to B" rule.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Salience State Example: Rule "A to B"</title>

        <programlisting>rule "A to B"
    when
        State(name == "A", state == State.FINISHED )
        b : State(name == "B", state == State.NOTRUN )
    then
        System.out.println(b.getName() + " finished" );
        b.setState( State.FINISHED );
end
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The execution of "A to B" rule changes the state of "B" to
      "FINISHED", which activates both rules "B to C" and "B to D", placing
      both Activations onto the Agenda. In this moment the two rules may fire
      and are said to be in conflict. The conflict resolution strategy allows
      the engine's Agenda to decide which rule to fire. As the "B to C" rule
      has a <emphasis role="bold">higher salience value</emphasis> (10 versus
      the default salience value of 0), it fires first, modifying the "C"
      object to state "FINISHED". The Audit view above shows the modification
      of the State object in the rule "A to B" which results in two
      highlighted activations being in conflict. The Agenda view can also be
      used to investigate the state of the Agenda, debug points can be placed
      in the rules themselves and the Agenda view opened; the screen shot
      below shows the break point in the rule "A to B" and the state of the
      Agenda with the two conflicting rules.</para>

    when
        State(name == "B", state == State.FINISHED )
        c : State(name == "C", state == State.NOTRUN )
    then
        System.out.println(c.getName() + " finished" );
        c.setState( State.FINISHED );
end
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The "B to D" rule fires last, modifying the "D" object to state
      "FINISHED".</para>

      <example>
        <title>Salience State Example: Rule "B to D"</title>

        <programlisting>rule "B to D"
    when
        State(name == "B", state == State.FINISHED )
        d : State(name == "D", state == State.NOTRUN )
    then
        System.out.println(d.getName() + " finished" );
        d.setState( State.FINISHED );
end</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>There are no more rules to execute and so the engine stops.</para>

      <para>Another notable concept in this example is the use of <emphasis
      role="bold">dynamic facts</emphasis>, which is the
      PropertyChangeListener part. As mentioned previously in the
      documentation, in order for the engine to see and react to fact's
      properties change, the application must tell the engine that changes
      occurred. This can be done explicitly in the rules, by calling the
      <emphasis role="bold">update()</emphasis> memory action, or implicitly
      by letting the engine know that the facts implement
      PropertyChangeSupport as defined by the <emphasis>Javabeans
      specification</emphasis>. This example demonstrates how to use
      PropertyChangeSupport to avoid the need for explicit update() calls in
      the rules. To make use of this feature, make sure your facts implement
      the PropertyChangeSupport as the org.drools.example.State class does and
      use the following code to insert the facts into the working
      memory:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Inserting a Dynamic Fact</title>

        <programlisting>// By setting dynamic to TRUE, Drools will use JavaBean
// PropertyChangeListeners so you don't have to call update().
final boolean dynamic = true;

session.insert( fact,
                dynamic );
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>When using PropertyChangeListeners each setter must implement a
      little extra code to do the notification, here is the state setter for
      thte org.drools.examples.State class:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Setter Example with PropertyChangeSupport</title>

        <programlisting>public void setState(final int newState) {
    int oldState = this.state;
    this.state = newState;
    this.changes.firePropertyChange( "state",
                                     oldState,
                                     newState );
}</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>There are two other State examples: StateExampleUsingAgendGroup
      and StateExampleWithDynamicRules. Both execute from A to B to C to D, as
      just shown, the StateExampleUsingAgendGroup uses agenda-groups to
      control the rule conflict and which one fires first and
      StateExampleWithDynamicRules shows how an additional rule can be added
      to an already running WorkingMemory with all the existing data applying
      to it at runtime.</para>

      <para>Agenda groups are a way to partition the agenda into groups and
      controlling which groups can execute. All rules by default are in the
      "MAIN" agenda group, by simply using the "agenda-group" attribute you
      specify a different agenda group for the rule. A working memory
      initially only has focus on the "MAIN" agenda group, only when other
      groups are given the focus can their rules fire; this can be achieved by
      either using the method setFocus() or the rule attribute "auto-focus".
      "auto-focus" means that the rule automatically sets the focus to it's
      agenda group when the rule is matched and activated. It is this
      "auto-focus" that enables "B to C" to fire before "B to D".</para>

      <example>
        <title>Agenda Group State Example: Rule "B to C"</title>

        <programlisting>rule "B to C"
      agenda-group "B to C"
      auto-focus true       
  when
      State(name == "B", state == State.FINISHED )      
      c : State(name == "C", state == State.NOTRUN )
  then
      System.out.println(c.getName() + " finished" );
      c.setState( State.FINISHED );
      drools.setFocus( "B to D" );
end</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The rule "B to C" calls "drools.setFocus( "B to D" );" which gives
      the agenda group "B to D" focus allowing its active rules to fire; which
      allows the rule "B to D" to fire.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Agenda Group State Example: Rule "B to D"</title>

        <programlisting>rule "B to D"
      agenda-group "B to D"
  when
      State(name == "B", state == State.FINISHED )      
      d : State(name == "D", state == State.NOTRUN )
  then
      System.out.println(d.getName() + " finished" );
      d.setState( State.FINISHED );
end</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The example StateExampleWithDynamicRules adds another rule to the
      RuleBase after fireAllRules(), the rule it adds is just another State
      transition.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Dynamic State Example: Rule "D to E"</title>

        <programlisting>rule "D to E"
  when
      State(name == "D", state == State.FINISHED )      
      e : State(name == "E", state == State.NOTRUN )
  then
      System.out.println(e.getName() + " finished" );
      e.setState( State.FINISHED );
end</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>It gives the following expected output:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Dynamic Sate Example Output</title>

        <programlisting>A finished
B finished
C finished
D finished
E finished

<emphasis role="bold">Main class:</emphasis> org.drools.tutorials.banking.*
<emphasis role="bold">Type:</emphasis> java application
<emphasis role="bold">Rules file:</emphasis> org.drools.tutorials.banking.*
<emphasis role="bold">Objective:</emphasis> tutorial that builds up knowledge of pattern matching, basic sorting and calculation rules.</programlisting>

    <para>This tutorial will demonstrate the process of developing a complete
    personal banking application that will handle credits, debits, currencies
    and that will use a set of design patterns that have been created for the
    process. In order to make the examples documented here clear and modular,
    I will try and steer away from re-visiting existing code to add new
    functionality, and will instead extend and inject where
    appropriate.</para>

    <para>The RuleRunner class is a simple harness to execute one or more drls
    against a set of data. It compiles the Packages and creates the RuleBase
    for each execution, this allows us to easy execute each scenario and see
    the outputs. In reality this is not a good solution for a production
    system where the RuleBase should be built just once and cached, but for
    the purposes of this tutorial it shall suffice.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : RuleRunner</title>

      <programlisting>public class RuleRunner {

    public RuleRunner() {
    }

    public void runRules(String[] rules,
                         Object[] facts) throws Exception {

        RuleBase ruleBase = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase();
        PackageBuilder builder = new PackageBuilder();

        for ( int i = 0; i &lt; rules.length; i++ ) {
            String ruleFile = rules[i];
            System.out.println( "Loading file: " + ruleFile );            
            builder.addPackageFromDrl(new InputStreamReader( RuleRunner.class.getResourceAsStream( ruleFile ) ) );
        }

        Package pkg = builder.getPackage();
        ruleBase.addPackage( pkg );
        WorkingMemory workingMemory = ruleBase.newStatefulSession();

        for ( int i = 0; i &lt; facts.length; i++ ) {
            Object fact = facts[i];
            System.out.println( "Inserting fact: " + fact );
            workingMemory.insert( fact );
        }

        workingMemory.fireAllRules();
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>This is our first Example1.java class it loads and executes a single
    drl file "Example.drl" but inserts no data.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Java Example1</title>

      <programlisting>public class Example1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example1.drl" },
                                   new Object[0] );
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>And this is the first simple rule to execute. It has a single "eval"
    condition that will alway be true, thus this rul will always match and
    fire.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Rule Example1</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Rule 01"   
    when
        eval (1==1)
    then
        System.out.println("Rule 01 Works");
endh</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The output for the rule is below, the rule matches and executes the
    single print statement.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Output Example1</title>

      <programlisting>Loading file: Example1.drl
Rule 01 Works</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The next step is to assert some simple facts and print them out.
    </para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Java Example2</title>

      <programlisting>public class Example2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Number[] numbers = new Number[] {wrap(3), wrap(1), wrap(4), wrap(1), wrap(5)};
        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example2.drl" },
                                   numbers );
    }
    
    private static Integer wrap(int i) {
        return new Integer(i);
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>This doesn’t use any specific facts but instead asserts a set of
    java.lang.Integer’s. This is not considered "best practice" as a number of
    a collection is not a fact, it is not a thing. A Bank acount has a number,
    its balance, thus the Account is the fact; but to get started asserting
    Integers shall suffice for demonstration purposes as the complexity is
    built up.</para>

    <para>Now we will create a simple rule to print out these numbers.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Rule Example2</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Rule 02"   
    when
        Number( $intValue : intValue )
    then
        System.out.println("Number found with value: " + $intValue); 
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Once again, this rule does nothing special. It identifies any facts
    that are Numbers and prints out the values. Notice the user of interfaces
    here, we inserted Integers but the pattern matching engine is able to
    match the interfaces and super classes of the asserted objects.</para>

    <para>The output shows the drl being loaded, the facts inserted and then
    the matched and fired rules. We can see that each inserted number is
    matched and fired and thus printed.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Output Example2</title>

      <programlisting>Loading file: Example2.drl
Inserting fact: 3
Inserting fact: 1
Inserting fact: 4
Inserting fact: 1
Inserting fact: 5
Number found with value: 5
Number found with value: 1
Number found with value: 4
Number found with value: 1
Number found with value: 3
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>here are probably a hundred and one better ways to sort numbers; but
    we will need to apply some cashflows in date order when we start looking
    at banking rules so let’s look at a simple rule based example.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Java Example3</title>

      <programlisting>public class Example3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Number[] numbers = new Number[] {wrap(3), wrap(1), wrap(4), wrap(1), wrap(5)};
        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example3.drl" },
                                   numbers );
    }
    
    private static Integer wrap(int i) {
        return new Integer(i);
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Again we insert our Integers as before, this time the rule is
    slightly different:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Rule Example3</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Rule 03"   
    when
        $number : Number( )
        not Number( intValue &lt; $number.intValue )
    then
        System.out.println("Number found with value: " + $number.intValue() ); 
        retract( $number );
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The first line of the rules identifies a Number and extracts the
    value. The second line ensures that there does not exist a smaller number
    than the one found. By executing this rule, we might expect to find only
    one number - the smallest in the set. However, the retraction of the
    number after it has been printed, means that the smallest number has been
    removed, revealing the next smallest number, and so on. </para>

    <para>So, the output we generate is, notice the numbers are now sorted
    numerically.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Output Example3</title>

      <programlisting>Loading file: Example3.drl
Inserting fact: 3
Inserting fact: 1
Inserting fact: 4
Inserting fact: 1
Inserting fact: 5
Number found with value: 1
Number found with value: 1
Number found with value: 3
Number found with value: 4
Number found with value: 5
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Now we want to start moving towards our personal accounting rules.
    The first step is to create a Cashflow POJO.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutoria : Class Cashflow</title>

      <programlisting>public class Cashflow {
    private Date   date;
    private double amount;

    public Cashflow() {
    }

    public Cashflow(Date date,
                    double amount) {
        this.date = date;
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    public Date getDate() {
        return date;
    }

    public void setDate(Date date) {
        this.date = date;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }

    public void setAmount(double amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Cashflow[date=" + date + ",amount=" + amount + "]";
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The Cashflow has two simple attributes, a date and an amount. I have
    added a toString method to print it and overloaded the constructor to set
    the values. The Example4 java code inserts 5 Cashflow objecst with varying
    dates and amounts.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Java Example4</title>

      <programlisting>public class Example4 {    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Object[] cashflows = {
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("01/01/2007"), 300.00),
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("05/01/2007"), 100.00),
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("11/01/2007"), 500.00),
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("07/01/2007"), 800.00),
            new Cashflow(new SimpleDate("02/01/2007"), 400.00),
        };
        
        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example4.drl" },
                                   cashflows );
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>SimpleDate is a simple class that extends Date and takes a String as
    input. It allows for pre-formatted Data classes, for convienience. The
    code is listed below</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Java SimpleDate</title>

      <programlisting>public class SimpleDate extends Date {
    private static final SimpleDateFormat format = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy");
    
    public SimpleDate(String datestr) throws Exception {             
        setTime(format.parse(datestr).getTime());
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Now, let’s look at rule04.drl to see how we print the sorted
    Cashflows:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Rule Example4</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Rule 04"   
    when
        $cashflow : Cashflow( $date : date, $amount : amount )
        not Cashflow( date &lt; $date)
    then
        System.out.println("Cashflow: "+$date+" :: "+$amount);  
        retract($cashflow);
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Here, we identify a Cashflow and extract the date and the amount. In
    the second line of the rules we ensure that there is not a Cashflow with
    an earlier date than the one found. In the consequences, we print the
    Cashflow that satisfies the rules and then retract it, making way for the
    next earliest Cashflow. So, the output we generate is:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Output Example4</title>

      <programlisting>Loading file: Example4.drl
Inserting fact: Cashflow[date=Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2007,amount=300.0]
Inserting fact: Cashflow[date=Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 GMT 2007,amount=100.0]
Inserting fact: Cashflow[date=Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 GMT 2007,amount=500.0]
Inserting fact: Cashflow[date=Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 GMT 2007,amount=800.0]
Inserting fact: Cashflow[date=Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2007,amount=400.0]
Cashflow: Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 300.0
Cashflow: Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 400.0
Cashflow: Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 100.0
Cashflow: Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 800.0
Cashflow: Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 500.0
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Here we extend our Cashflow to give a TypedCashflow which can be
    CREDIT or DEBIT. Ideally, we would just add this to the Cashflow type, but
    so that we can keep all the examples simple, we will go with the
    extensions.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutoria : Class TypedCashflow</title>

      <programlisting>public class TypedCashflow extends Cashflow {
    public static final int CREDIT = 0;
    public static final int DEBIT  = 1;

    private int             type;

    public TypedCashflow() {
    }

    public TypedCashflow(Date date,
                         int type,
                         double amount) {
        super( date,
               amount );
        this.type = type;
    }

    public int getType() {
        return type;
    }

    public void setType(int type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "TypedCashflow[date=" + getDate() + ",type=" + (type == CREDIT ? "Credit" : "Debit") + ",amount=" + getAmount() + "]";
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>There are lots of ways to improve this code, but for the sake of the
    example this will do.</para>

    <para>Nows lets create the Example5 runner.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Java Example5</title>

      <programlisting>public class Example5 {    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {      
        Object[] cashflows = {
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("01/01/2007"),    
                              TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 300.00),
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("05/01/2007"),
                              TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 100.00),
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("11/01/2007"),
                              TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 500.00),
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("07/01/2007"),
                              TypedCashflow.DEBIT, 800.00),
            new TypedCashflow(new SimpleDate("02/01/2007"),
                              TypedCashflow.DEBIT, 400.00),
        };
        
        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example5.drl" },
                                   cashflows );
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Here, we simply create a set of Cashflows which are either CREDIT or
    DEBIT Cashflows and supply them and rule05.drl to the RuleEngine. </para>

    <para>Now, let’s look at rule0 Example5.drl to see how we print the sorted
    Cashflows:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Rule Example5</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Rule 05"  
    when
        $cashflow : TypedCashflow( $date : date,
                                   $amount : amount,
                                   type == TypedCashflow.CREDIT )
        not TypedCashflow( date &lt; $date,
                           type == TypedCashflow.CREDIT )
    then
        System.out.println("Credit: "+$date+" :: "+$amount);   
        retract($cashflow);
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Here, we identify a Cashflow with a type of CREDIT and extract the
    date and the amount. In the second line of the rules we ensure that there
    is not a Cashflow of type CREDIT with an earlier date than the one found.
    In the consequences, we print the Cashflow that satisfies the rules and
    then retract it, making way for the next earliest Cashflow of type
    CREDIT.</para>

    <para>So, the output we generate is</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Output Example5</title>

      <programlisting>Loading file: Example5.drl
Inserting fact: TypedCashflow[date=Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2007,type=Credit,amount=300.0]
Inserting fact: TypedCashflow[date=Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 GMT 2007,type=Credit,amount=100.0]
Inserting fact: TypedCashflow[date=Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 GMT 2007,type=Credit,amount=500.0]
Inserting fact: TypedCashflow[date=Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 GMT 2007,type=Debit,amount=800.0]
Inserting fact: TypedCashflow[date=Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2007,type=Debit,amount=400.0]
Credit: Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 300.0
Credit: Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 100.0
Credit: Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 GMT 2007 :: 500.0
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Here we are going to process both CREDITs and DEBITs on 2 bank
    accounts to calculate the account balance. In order to do this, I am going
    to create two separate Account Objects and inject them into the Cashflows
    before passing them to the Rule Engine. The reason for this is to provide
    easy access to the correct Bank Accounts without having to resort to
    Helper classes. Let’s take a look at the Account class first. This is a
    simple POJO with an account number and balance:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutoria : Class Account</title>

      <programlisting>public class Account {
    private long   accountNo;
    private double balance = 0;

    public Account() {
    }

    public Account(long accountNo) {
        this.accountNo = accountNo;
    }

    public long getAccountNo() {
        return accountNo;
    }

    public void setAccountNo(long accountNo) {
        this.accountNo = accountNo;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void setBalance(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Account[" + "accountNo=" + accountNo + ",balance=" + balance + "]";
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Now let’s extend our TypedCashflow to give AllocatedCashflow
    (allocated to an account).</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutoria : Class AllocatedCashflow</title>

      <programlisting>public class AllocatedCashflow extends TypedCashflow {
    private Account account;

    public AllocatedCashflow() {

    <para>Now, let’s java code for Example5 execution. Here we create two
    Account objects and inject one into each cashflow as appropriate. For
    simplicity I have simply included them in the constructor.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Java Example5</title>

      <programlisting>public class Example6 {    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {      
        Account acc1 = new Account(1);
        Account acc2 = new Account(2);
           
        Object[] cashflows = {
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("01/01/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 300.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("05/02/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 100.00),

            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("07/02/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.DEBIT,  800.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc2,new SimpleDate("02/03/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.DEBIT,  400.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("01/04/2007"),    
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 200.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("05/04/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 300.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc2,new SimpleDate("11/05/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.CREDIT, 700.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc1,new SimpleDate("07/05/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.DEBIT,  900.00),
            new AllocatedCashflow(acc2,new SimpleDate("02/05/2007"),
                                  TypedCashflow.DEBIT,  100.00)           
        };
        
        new RuleRunner().runRules( new String[] { "Example6.drl" },
                                   cashflows );
    }
}</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Now, let’s look at rule Example06.drl to see how we apply each
    cashflow in date order and calculate and print the balance. </para>

    <example>
      <title>Banking Tutorial : Rule Example6</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Rule 06 - Credit"  
    when
        $cashflow : AllocatedCashflow( $account : account,
                                       $date : date, $amount : amount,
                                        type==TypedCashflow.CREDIT )
        not AllocatedCashflow( account == $account, date &lt; $date)
    then
        System.out.println("Credit: " + $date + " :: " + $amount);     
        $account.setBalance($account.getBalance()+$amount);
        System.out.println("Account: " + $account.getAccountNo() +
                           " - new balance: " + $account.getBalance());          
        retract($cashflow);
end

rule "Rule 06 - Debit"  
    when
        $cashflow : AllocatedCashflow( $account : account,
                            $date : date, $amount : amount,
                            type==TypedCashflow.DEBIT )
        not AllocatedCashflow( account == $account, date &lt; $date)
    then
        System.out.println("Debit: " + $date + " :: " + $amount);      
        $account.setBalance($account.getBalance() - $amount);
        System.out.println("Account: " + $account.getAccountNo() +
                           " - new balance: " + $account.getBalance());           
        retract($cashflow);
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Here, we have separate rules for CREDITs and DEBITs, however we do
    not specify a type when checking for earlier cashflows. This is so that
    all cashflows are applied in date order regardless of which type of
    cashflow type they are. In the rule section we identify the correct
    account to work with and in the consequences we update it with the
    cashflow amount.</para>

    invented by Leonardo of Pisa, <ulink
    url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci</ulink>,
    are obtained by starting with 0 and 1, and then produce the next Fibonacci
    number by adding the two previous Fibonacci numbers. The first Fibonacci
    numbers for n = 0, 1,... are: * 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,
    144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946... The Fibonacci
    Example demonstrates recursion and conflict resolution with Salience
    values.</para>

    <para>A single fact Class is used in this example, Fibonacci. It has two
    fields, sequence and value. The sequence field is used to indicate the
    position of the object in the Fibonacci number sequence and the value
    field shows the value of that Fibonacci object for that sequence
    position.</para>

49 == 7778742049
50 == 12586269025
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>To kick this off from java we only insert a single Fibonacci object,
    with a sequence of 50, a recurse rule is then used to insert the other 49
    Fibonacci objects. This example doesn't use PropertyChangeSupport and uses
    the MVEL dialect, this means we can use the <emphasis
    role="bold">modify</emphasis> keyword, which allows a block setter action
    which also notifies the engine of changes.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Fibonacci Example Execution</title>

      <programlisting>session.insert( new Fibonacci( 50 ) );
session.fireAllRules();</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The recurse rule is very simple, it matches each asserted Fibonacci
    object with a value of -1, it then creates and asserts a new Fibonacci
    object with a sequence of one less than the currently matched object. Each
    time a Fibonacci object is added, as long as one with a "sequence == 1"
    does not exist, the rule re-matches again and fires; causing the
    recursion. The 'not' conditional element is used to stop the rule matching
    once we have all 50 Fibonacci objects in memory. The rule also has a
    salience value, this is because we need to have all 50 Fibonacci objects
    asserted before we execute the Bootstrap rule.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Fibonacci Example : Rule "Recurse"</title>

      <programlisting>rule Recurse
    salience 10
    when
        f : Fibonacci ( value == -1 )
        not ( Fibonacci ( sequence == 1 ) )
    then
        insert( new Fibonacci( f.sequence - 1 ) );
        System.out.println( "recurse for " + f.sequence );
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The audit view shows the original assertion of the Fibonacci object
    with a sequence of 50, this was done from Java land. From there the audit
    view shows the continual recursion of the rule, each asserted Fibonacci
    causes the "Recurse" rule to become activate again, which then
    fires.</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>When a Fibonacci with a sequence of 2 is asserted the "Bootstrap"
    rule is matched and activated along with the "Recurse" rule.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Fibonacci Example : Rule "Bootstrap"</title>

      <programlisting>rule Bootstrap
    when
        f : Fibonacci( sequence == 1 || == 2, value == -1 ) // this is a multi-restriction || on a single field
    then 
        modify ( f ){ value = 1 };
        System.out.println( f.sequence + " == " + f.value );
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>At this point the Agenda looks like the figure shown below. However
    the "Bootstrap" rule does not fire as the "Recurse" rule has a higher
    salience.</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>When a Fibonacci with a sequence of 1 is asserted the "Bootstrap"
    rule is matched again, causing two activations for this rule; note that
    the "Recurse" rule does not match and activate because the 'not
    conditional element stops the rule matching when a Fibonacci with a
    sequence of 1 exists.</para>

    </figure>

    <para>Once we have two Fibonacci objects both with values not equal to -1
    the "calculate" rule is able to match; remember it was the "Bootstrap"
    rule that set the Fibonacci's with sequences 1 and 2 to values of 1. At
    this point we have 50 Fibonacci objects in the Working Memory and we some
    how need to select the correct ones to calculate each of their values in
    turn. With three Fibonacci patterns in a rule with no field constriants to
    correctly constrain the available cross products we have 50x50x50 possible
    permutations, thats 125K possible rule firings. The "Calculate" rule uses
    the field constraints to correctly constraint the thee Fibonacci patterns
    and in the correct order; this technique is called "cross product
    matching". The first pattern finds any Fibonacci with a value != -1 and
    binds both the pattern and the field. The second Fibonacci does too but it
    adds an additional field constraint to make sure that its sequence is one
    greater than the Fibonacci bound to f1. When this rule first fires we know
    that only sequences 1 and 2 have values of 1 and the two constraints
    ensure that f1 references sequence 1 and f2 references sequence2. The
    final pattern finds the Fibonacci of a value == -1 with a sequence one
    greater than f2. At this point we have three Fibonacci objects correctly
    selected from the available cross products and we can do the maths
    calculating the value for Fibonacci sequence = 3.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Fibonacci Example : Rule "Calculate"</title>

      <programlisting>rule Calculate
    when
        f1 : Fibonacci( s1 : sequence, value != -1 ) // here we bind sequence
        f2 : Fibonacci( sequence == (s1 + 1 ), value != -1 ) // here we don't, just to demonstrate the different way bindings can be used
        f3 : Fibonacci( s3 : sequence == (f2.sequence + 1 ), value == -1 )              
    then    
        modify ( f3 ) { value = f1.value + f2.value };
        System.out.println( s3 + " == " + f3.value ); // see how you can access pattern and field  bindings
end 
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The MVEL modify keyword updated the value of the Fibonacci object
    bound to f3, this means we have a new Fibonacci object with a value != -1,
    this allows the "Calculate" rule to rematch and calculate the next
    Fibonacci number. The Audit view below shows the how the firing of the
    last "Bootstrap" modifies the Fibonacci object enabling the "Calculate"
    rule to match, which then modifies another Fibonacci object allowing the
    "Calculate" rule to rematch. This continues till the value is set for all
    Fibonacci objects.</para>

<emphasis role="bold">Type:</emphasis> java application
<emphasis role="bold">Rules file:</emphasis> golf.drl
<emphasis role="bold">Objective:</emphasis> Configuration example that finds the solution from a large number of available cross products
</programlisting>

    <para>The golf example solves a "riddle" style problem that is simple
    enough to state in sentences, but for which a conventional algorithmic
    solition is not obvious. It does this by searching for a suitable
    combination from a "space" of possible solutions.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The riddle</title>

      <para>The problem is written as a riddle:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A foursome of golfers is standing at a tee, in a line from
          left to right.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Each golfer wears different colored pants; one is wearing red
          pants.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The golfer to Fred’s immediate right is wearing blue
          pants.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Joe is second in line.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Bob is wearing plaid pants.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Tom isn’t in position one or four, and he isn’t wearing the
          hideous orange pants.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The immediate thing about this riddle, is that a solution is not
      obvious (of course ! it wouldn't be a riddle otherwise !). It also isn't
      obvious how to write an algorithm to solve it (if it is for you - then
      you can take a break now, go have a coffee or someting to reward your
      uber intellect).</para>

      <para>Instead of thinking about how to solve it, we can be lazy and use
      rules instead. So we don't attempt to solve it, we just state the
      problem in rules, and let the engine derive the solution.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Launching the example</title>

      <para>The supporting code is in the GolfingExample.java class. There is
      an inner class "Golfer" which represents a golf player, it has their
      name, position (1 to 4 meaning left to right), and their pants color, as
      simple properties.</para>

      <programlisting>String[] names = new String[] { "Fred", "Joe", "Bob", "Tom" };
String[] colors = new String[] { "red", "blue", "plaid", "orange" };
int[] positions = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
        
for ( int n = 0; n &lt; names.length; n++ ) {
    for ( int c = 0; c &lt; colors.length; c++ ) {
        for ( int p = 0; p &lt; positions.length; p++ ) {
            session.insert( new Golfer( names[n], colors[c], positions[p]) );
        }                
    }            
}      </programlisting>

      <para>The above listing shows the interesting part of the supporting
      code. Note that we have arrays representing each name, color, and
      position. We then go through a nested loop inserting instances of Golfer
      - so in the working memory we will have all combinations of name, color
      and position. It is then the job of the rules to find the appropriate
      one.</para>

      <para>Launching the code as a java application should yield the
      following output:</para>

      <programlisting>Fred 1 orange

      <title>The matching rule</title>

      <para>The solution in rules is quite simple, it is a single rule which
      expresses the constraints as stated in the riddle. Effectively, we can
      interpret the riddle as a series of constraints on our object model.
      Given that we have enough "combinations" in the working memory, all we
      have to do is express the constraints in a rule and the engine will
      match it with a solution (we don't really care how it does it, as long
      as it works !).</para>

      <para>There is one rule in the solution, in golf.drl, called "find
      solution". The rule is made up of 5 patterns, with constraints that map
      to items in the riddle.</para>

      <programlisting>$fred : Golfer( name == "Fred" )      </programlisting>

      <para>In the above pattern, we are simply matching a Golfer who is
      called fred, and binding it to a variable called $fred. All that we know
      is that there is a golfer called fred.</para>

      <programlisting>$joe : Golfer( name == "Joe",
               position == 2,
               position != $fred.position,
               color != $fred.color )      </programlisting>

      <para>The next pattern says that we have a golfer named Joe, in position
      2 ("second in line"). Now, we also know that he must NOT be in the same
      position as fred (of course !) and have different color pants. So far,
      nothing that amazing.</para>

      <programlisting>$bob : Golfer( name == "Bob",
               position != $fred.position,
               position != $joe.position,
               color == "plaid",
               color != $fred.color,
               color != $joe.color )      </programlisting>

      <para>Refering to the above, we also know there is a golfer called Bob,
      who wears plaid pants - once again that all we know about him. but of
      course, we add in the constraints that he must be in a different
      position to fred, joe, and also have different colored pants.</para>

      <programlisting>$tom : Golfer( name == "Tom",
               position != 1,
               position != 4,
               position != $fred.position,
               position != $joe.position,
               position != $bob.position,
               color != "orange,               
               color != $fred.color,
               color != $joe.color,
               color != $bob.color )      </programlisting>

      <para>(referring to the above) We also know that there is a guy called
      Tom, who doesn't wear the Orange pants, AND he is not in position 1, or
      4. Of course we also add in the other constraints (he must be in a
      different position to the others so far, and have a different
      color).</para>

      <programlisting>Golfer( position == ( $fred.position + 1 ),
        color == "blue",
        this in ( $joe, $bob, $tom ) )      </programlisting>

      <para>Finally, we know that the golfer on the right of Fred (position +
      1), is in blue pants. We also add in the constraint that he must be
      either Joe, Bob or Tom (as Fred can't be beside himself, well he can I
      guess, but not in the sense we mean here !) - note the use of "this" to
      refer to the current pattern, we don't really care who "this" is, just
      who they are not. Maybe if Fred was really really happy they this
      wouldn't work, but lets assume otherwise for now.</para>

      <para>Thats it ! We have expressed the rule as constraints that map to
      the ones expressed in the riddle, yet we haven't had to solve the
      riddle, the engine does that for us.</para>

      <title>Conclustion</title>

      <para>This simple example shows how you can express a problem
      declaratively, and let the engine solve the problem for you, by making
      use of combinations. This is an often useful technique, as it allows you
      to express rules as a statement of the problem you are trying to
      solve.</para>

      <para>Of course, care must be taken. Using combinatorics like this can
      cause performance problems when there are large numbers of facts (eg in
      this case, if there were a larger number of golfers, or colors/positions
      etc - possibilities). When the fact count grows, the combinations the
      engine has to deal with can explode exponentially, making this not very
      efficient. However, in cases where the rules are perhaps complex, the
      problem is hard, but the fact numbers are relatively low, this approach
      can be very very useful and help you solve problems that would otherwise
      be very hard.</para>

    <title>Trouble Ticket</title>

    <para>The trouble ticket example shows how to use the duration attribute
    for temporal rules, and also includes an alternative version using a
    dsl.</para>

    <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">Name:</emphasis> TroubleTicket
<emphasis role="bold">Main class:</emphasis> org.drools.examples.TroubleTicketExample, org.drools.examples.TroubleTicketExampleWithDSL
<emphasis role="bold">Type:</emphasis> java application
<emphasis role="bold">Rules file:</emphasis> TroubleTicket.drl, TroubleTicketWithDSL.dslr
<emphasis role="bold">Objective:</emphasis> Show temporal rules in action
</programlisting>

    <para>The trouble ticket example is based around the idea of raising a
    "ticket" (ie an issue) with a vendor (these are the vendors rules). Each
    customer has a subscription class assigned to it (eg Gold, Silver etc) and
    their class determines how the ticket is treated with respect to time, and
    escalating the issue. The normal drl version will be discussed here, but
    logically the DSL version is the same (it just uses a DSL defined language
    instead of the normal DRL).</para>

    <para>We have 2 types of facts, Customer and Ticket. A Ticket belongs to
    one and only one customer. A Customer has a name and a "subscription" type
    (Gold, Silver or Platinum). A ticket also has a "status" - which
    determines (obviously) what state it is in. The state may be set
    externally, or by the rules engine (eg it starts out "New", and then the
    system user determines that it is "Done" at some later point). The rules
    exist to ensure that the tickets are escalated appropriately based on the
    customer subscription class.</para>

    <para>Customers can choose Silver, Gold, or Platinum (in order of
    increasing responsiveness). Platinum subscriptions also come with a set of
    steak knives, and a personal butler to lodge the ticket for you (but
    obviously it costs more).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Executing the Example</title>

      <para>The example creates 4 customers, with their name and subscription
      class, it then creates 4 tickets for each of the customers, note that
      the ticket takes the customer in the constructor (that sets up the
      object relationship. The tickets and the customers are then inserted.
      Notice that we keep a fact handle - which we will use to notify the
      engine that that specific ticket changed later on. The last line has the
      all important fireAllRules(), which tells the engine to take action on
      the data it has.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Trouble Ticket Example : Creating and Inserting Facts</title>

        <programlisting>Customer a = new Customer( "A",
                           "Gold" );
Customer b = new Customer( "B",
                           "Platinum" );
Customer c = new Customer( "C",
                           "Silver" );
Customer d = new Customer( "D",
                           "Silver" );

Ticket t1 = new Ticket( a );
Ticket t2 = new Ticket( b );
Ticket t3 = new Ticket( c );
Ticket t4 = new Ticket( d );

session.insert( a );
session.insert( b );
session.insert( c );
session.insert( d );

session.insert( t1 );
session.insert( t2 );
FactHandle ft3 = session.insert( t3 );
session.insert( t4 );

session.fireAllRules();</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>We have the "New Ticket" rule which has the highest priority
      (salience of 10 - the default is zero), The purpose of this is simply to
      log the fact that a new ticket has arrived in the system:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "New Ticket"
 salience 10
 when
  customer : Customer( )
  ticket : Ticket( customer == customer, status == "New" )
  then
 System.out.println( "New : " + ticket );
end    </programlisting>

      <para>Note that we are "joining" the ticket fact with the customer fact.
      It's not really needed in this case, as we don't do anything (yet) with
      the customer fact. If you look in the TroubleTicketExample.java, you
      will also see that the facts are being inserted into the engine - note
      that we assert BOTH Customer and Ticket object (even though the ticket
      belongs to a customer - this allows the engine to join the objects
      together how it wants - this is what is meant by "relational"
      programming - we let the rule engine define what the relationships are.
      For instance, although the code is structured so that a ticket belongs
      to a customer, we may be interested in looking at tickets from different
      customers of the same type in the future).</para>

      <para>If we run the rules, we should expect that the "New Ticket" rule
      will be activated for all tickets, so looking at the audit log view (by
      opening the file which was saved automatically when the rules were
      run):</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Audit view</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Referring to the above audit log, we can see each customer
      asserted, but nothing happens. As soon as the first ticket gets
      asserted, it joins it with the customer, and creates some activations:
      one is the "new ticket" rule, the other is for the appropriate priority
      (which we will show below). Note that items in the above view do not
      mean the rule fired at that point.</para>

      <para>Also, don't forget to use "fireAllRules()" - a common mistake !
      (In this case we are using a statefull session, so this is
      necessary).</para>

      <title>Platinum gets the best service</title>

      <para>All the wonderful platinum customers have to get great service, so
      first thing to note is that as soon as a ticket arrives, we escalate if
      it is for a platinum customer:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Platinum Priority"
 when
  customer : Customer( subscription == "Platinum" )
  ticket : Ticket( customer == customer, status == "New" )
 then;
  ticket.setStatus( "Escalate" );
  update( ticket );
end      </programlisting>

      <para>Here we are joining Ticket to customer again (customer ==
      customer), but we are also checking that the customer is "Platinum".
      When this is the case, we set the ticket status to "Escalate" and call
      update (which tells the engine that the ticket has changed).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Silver and Gold</title>

      <para>For silver and gold class, its a similar story to platinum:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Silver Priority"
 duration 3000
 when
  customer : Customer( subscription == "Silver" )
  ticket : Ticket( customer == customer, status == "New" )
 then
  ticket.setStatus( "Escalate" );
  update( ticket );
end

rule "Gold Priority"
 duration 1000
 when
  customer : Customer( subscription == "Gold" )
  ticket : Ticket( customer == customer, status == "New" )
 then
  ticket.setStatus( "Escalate" );
  update( ticket );
end   </programlisting>

      <para>In this case, note the use of "duration XXX" - XXX is the number
      of milliseconds to wait to check that this rule holds true. Should it do
      so, after XXX milliseconds, then the action takes effect. So in the
      above case, after 3 seconds the "Silver" priority kicks in, but after 1
      second "Gold" does. In both cases the tickets are escalated (just like
      with platinum. This is what we mean by temporal rules (rules that take
      effect over time).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Escalating</title>

      <para>The actual escalation of a ticket happens in a rule:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Escalate"
 when
  customer : Customer( )
  ticket : Ticket( customer == customer, status == "Escalate" )
 then
  sendEscalationEmail( customer, ticket );
end     </programlisting>

      <para>In this case, the action is to call a function which sends an
      email (the function is defined down the bottom of the drl file). This
      rule reacts to the rules which update the ticket and set its status to
      escalate.</para>
    </section>

    <para>In the code that launches the example, we have a "sleep" to make
    sure all this happens (and print out the results). Note also that after
    the rules are fired, we modify the status of the Customer "C" to "Done" -
    and then tell the engine. This causes it to evaluate and fire the rule
    that looks for "tickets" that are "Done" (in which is just logs a
    message).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Running it</title>

      <para>Running the example (by launching the TroubleTicket.java class as
      an application) should yield the output:</para>

      <programlisting>New : [Ticket [Customer D : Silver] : New]
New : [Ticket [Customer C : Silver] : New]
New : [Ticket [Customer B : Platinum] : New]
New : [Ticket [Customer A : Gold] : New]
Email : [Ticket [Customer B : Platinum] : Escalate]
[[ Sleeping 5 seconds ]]
Email : [Ticket [Customer A : Gold] : Escalate]
Done : [Ticket [Customer C : Silver] : Done]
Email : [Ticket [Customer D : Silver] : Escalate]
[[ awake ]]    </programlisting>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Referring to the above audit log, we can see the events as they
      happen. Once the rules start firing, the first items are the "Activation
      Executed" for the new tickets, as expected (they do nothing, just log
      the fact). Note the "Activation executed" item for the platinum ticket -
      that is the next one to go (remember it has the default salience, so it
      happens after the "New ticket" rule, but otherwise it is immediate -
      there is no "duration" delay for it). The platinum activation results in
      a Object modification (which is the escalation) - this in turn creates
      an activation record for the "escalate ticket" rule - which is what we
      wanted. Straight after that it executes the action to escalate the
      ticket.</para>

      <para>The next event to occur is due to the: <programlisting>t3.setStatus( "Done" );

session.update( ft3,
                t3 );
</programlisting> in the code (outside of rules) - this simulates a customer
      service officer maarking a ticket as done (and of course, uses the fact
      handle we kept from before). This results in a cancelled activation (as
      we no longer have a New Silvert customer ticket - it is done) and a new
      activation to log the fact it was done.</para>

      <para>In all the excitement, in parallel the engine has been watching
      the time pass, and it happens that the Gold tickets start to escalate,
      and then silver (as expected).</para>

    <title>Pricing Rule Decision Table Example</title>

    <para>The Pricing Rule decision table demonstrates the use of a decision
    table in a spreadsheet (XLS format) in calculating the retail cost of an
    insurance policy. The purpose of the set of rules provided is to calculate
    a base price, and an additional discount for a car driver applying for a
    specific policy. The drivers age, history and the policy type all
    contribute to what the basic premium is, and an additional chunk of rules
    deals with refining this with a subtractive percentage discount.</para>

    <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">Name:</emphasis> Example Policy Pricing

<emphasis role="bold">Objective:</emphasis> demonstrate spreadsheet based decision tables.    </programlisting>

    <section>
      <title>Executing the example</title>

      <para>Open the PricingRuleDTExample.java and execute it as a Java
      application. It should produce the following console output:</para>

      <programlisting>Cheapest possible
BASE PRICE IS: 120
DISCOUNT IS: 20     </programlisting>

      <para>The code to the execute the example is very similar to the other
      examples. The rules are loaded, the facts inserted and a stateless
      session is used. What is different is how the rules are obtained:</para>

      <programlisting>SpreadsheetCompiler compiler = new SpreadsheetCompiler();
String drl = compiler.compile(getSpreadsheetStream(), InputType.XLS);
</programlisting>

      <para>Note the use of the SpreadsheetCompiler class. It is what takes
      the XLS (as a binary InputStream to the XLS file), and outputs ordinary
      DRL (which is then dealt with in the usual way). You can (if you like)
      also print out the DRL. If you use the BRMS, all this is of course taken
      care of for you.</para>

      <para>There are 2 facts used in this example, Driver, and Policy. Both
      are used with their default values. The Driver is 30 years old, has had
      no prior claims and currently has a risk profile of LOW. The Policy
      being applied for is COMPREHENSIVE, and the policy has not yet been
      approved.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The decision table</title>

      <para>In this decision table, each row is a rule, and each column is a
      condition or an action.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Decision table configuration</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="DT_Config.png" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Referring to the above, we have the RuleSet declaration, which
      provides the package name. There are also other optional items you can
      have here, such as Variables for global variables, and Imports for
      importing classes. In this case, the namespace of the rules is the same
      as the fact classes we are using, so we can omit it.</para>

      <para>Moving further down, we can see the RuleTable declaration. The
      name after this (Pricing bracket) is used as the prefix for all the
      generated rules. Below that, we have CONDITION or ACTION - this
      indicates the purpose of the column (ie does it form part of the
      condition, or an action of a rule that will be generated).</para>

      <para>You can see there is a Driver which is spanned across 3 cells,
      this means the template expressions below it apply to that fact. So we
      look at the drivers age range (which uses $1 and $2 with comma separated
      values), locationRiskProfile, and priorClaims in the respective columns.
      In the action columns, we are setting the policy base price, and then
      logging a message.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Base price calculation</title>

        <mediaobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Referring to the above, we can see there are broad category
      brackets (indicated by the comment in the left most column). As we know
      the details of our driver and their policy, we can tell (with a bit of
      thought) that they should match row number 18, as they have no prior
      accidents, and are 30 years old. This gives us a base price of
      120.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Discount calculation</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Referring to the above, we are seeing if there is any discount we
      can give our driver. Based on the Age bracket, number of priot claims,
      and the policy type, a discount is provided. In our case, the drive is
      3, with no priors, and they are applying for COMPREHENSIVE, this means
      we can give a discount of 20%. Note that this is actually a separate
      table, but in the same worksheet. This different templates apply.</para>

      <para>It is important to note that decision tables generate rules, this
      means they aren't simply top down logic, but more a means to capture
      data that generate rules (this is a subtle difference that confuses some
      people). The evaluation of the rules is not "top down" necessarily, all
      the normal indexing and mechanics of the rule engine still apply.</para>

session.retract( hatPurchaseHandle );
System.out.println( "Customer mark has returned the hat" );
session.fireAllRules();      </programlisting>

      <para>Refering the the above listing, we can see there is a Customer
      ("mark"), and there are 2 Products ("shoes" and "hat") which are
      available for Purchase. In this case, a Purchase combines a customer
      with a product (and a product has a price attribute).</para>

      <para>Note that after we fireAllRules(), we then retract the purchase of
      a hat (but leave the purchase of shoes in). Running the example as a
      java application should see the following output:</para>

      <programlisting>Customer mark just purchased hat
Customer mark just purchased shoes
Customer mark now has a shopping total of 120.0
Customer mark now has a discount of 10
Customer mark has returned the hat
Customer mark now has a discount of 0      </programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Discounts and purchases</title>

      <para>We want to give discounts to customers who purchase stuff of
      enough value. This discount could also be removed should the customer
      decide not to purchase enough to fall within the threshold.</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Purchase notification"
    salience 10

 when
  $c : Customer()
  $p : Purchase( customer == $c)	    
 then
     System.out.println( "Customer " + $c.name + " just purchased " + $p.product.name );
end 

rule "Discount removed notification"
 when
     $c : Customer()
  not Discount( customer == $c )
 then
  $c.discount = 0 ;
  System.out.println( "Customer " + $c.name + " now has a discount of " + $c.discount );
end

rule "Discount awarded notification"
 when
     $c : Customer()
     $d : Discount( customer == $c )
 then
  System.out.println( "Customer " + $c.name + " now has a discount of " + $d.amount );
end      </programlisting>

      <para>The "Purchase notification" rule simply makes note of the purchase
      event for a given customer. The "Discount removed notification" rule
      removes the customer discount (by checking for the non existence of a
      discount for that customer). The "Discount awarded notification" simply
      makes not of the fact that the discount was applied.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Calculating the discount</title>

      <para>Calculating the discount is done with a single rule, using the
      higher order logic of "accumulate".</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Apply 10% discount if total purcahses is over 100"
 no-loop true
 dialect "java"
    when
      $c : Customer()
      $i : Double(doubleValue  &gt; 100) from accumulate ( Purchase( customer == $c, $price : product.price ), 
                                                            sum( $price ) )
    then
      $c.setDiscount( 10 );
      insertLogical( new Discount($c, 10) );
      System.out.println( "Customer " + $c.getName() + " now has a shopping total of " + $i );
end      </programlisting>

      <para>An interesting part of this rule is the "accumulate": this is
      saying to accumulate a total (sum) of the $price of a product
      (product.price) for all Purchase facts that belong to the customer ($c).
      The result of this is a Double. The rule then checks to see if this
      total is greater then 100. If it is, it applies the discount (of 10),
      and then inserts a logical fact of the Discount object.</para>

      <para>The purpose of the logical insertion of the Discount, is to
      automatically retract the Discount object should the total of the
      purchases not add up to &gt; 100 (when the LHS is no longer satisified,
      restract the resulting logical assertions - this is what is meant by
      "truth maintenance"). The act of inserting the Discount, causes the
      "Discount awarded notification" rule to activate. However, should the
      discount fact be retracted, the "Discount removed notification" will
      activate, resulting in the customers discount being wiped out. In the
      example you can see this happen, as after the first fireAllRules(), a
      purchase is retracted, causing the total to fall below 100, which means
      the conditions that satisfied the "Apply 10% discount..." rule no longer
      apply, hence the logical fact of "Discount" is automatically
      retracted.</para>

<emphasis role="bold">Type:</emphasis> Java application
<emphasis role="bold">Rules file:</emphasis> PetStore.drl
<emphasis role="bold">Objective:</emphasis> Demonstrate use of Agenda Groups, Global Variables and integration with a GUI (including callbacks from within the Rules)
</programlisting>

      <para>The Pet Store example shows how to integrate Rules with a GUI (in
      this case a Swing based Desktop application). Within the rules file, it
      shows how to use agenda groups and auto-focus to control which of a set
      of rules is allowed to fire at any given time. It also shows mixing of
      Java and MVEL dialects within the rules, the use of accumulate functions
      and calling of Java functions from within the ruleset.</para>

      <para>Like the rest of the the samples, all the Java Code is contained
      in one file. The PetStore.java contains the following principal classes
      (in addition to several minor classes to handle Swing Events)</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">PetStoreUI</emphasis> - responsible

            events such as mouse and button clicks.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">TabelModel</emphasis> - for holding

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>Much of the Java code is either JavaBeans (simple enough to
      understand) or Swing based. We will touch on some Swing related points
      in the this tutorial , but a good place to get more Swing component
      information is <ulink
      url="???"><uri>http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/</uri>available
      at the Sun Swing website.<citebiblioid /></ulink></para>

      <para>There are two important Rules related pieces of Java code in
      <emphasis role="italic">Petstore.java</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>
        <example>
          <title>Creating the PetStore RuleBase - extract from PetStore.java
          main() method</title>

          <programlisting>PackageBuilder builder = new PackageBuilder();
builder.addPackageFromDrl( new InputStreamReader( 
PetStore.class.getResourceAsStream( "PetStore.drl" ) ) );
RuleBase ruleBase = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase();
ruleBase.addPackage( builder.getPackage() );

//RuleB
Vector stock = new Vector();
stock.add( new Product( "Gold Fish",5 ) );
stock.add( new Product( "Fish Tank", 25 ) );
stock.add( new Product( "Fish Food", 2 ) );

//The callback is responsible for populating working memory and
// fireing all rules
PetStoreUI ui = new PetStoreUI( stock, new CheckoutCallback( ruleBase ) );
ui.createAndShowGUI();
</programlisting>
        </example>
      </para>

      <para>This code above loads the rules (drl) file from the classpath.
      Unlike other examples where the facts are asserted and fired straight
      away, this example defers this step to later. The way it does this is
      via the second last line where the PetStoreUI is created using a
      constructor the passes in the Vector called stock containing products ,
      and an instance of the CheckoutCallback class containing the RuleBase
      that we have just loaded.</para>

      <para>The actual Javacode that fires the rules is within the <emphasis
      role="italic">CheckoutCallBack.checkout()</emphasis> method. This is
      triggered (eventually) when the 'Checkout' button is pressed by the
      user.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Firing the Rules - extract from the CheckOutCallBack.checkout()
        method</title>

        <programlisting>public String checkout(JFrame frame, List items) throws FactException {           
    Order order = new Order();

    //Iterate through list and add to cart
    for ( int i = 0; i &lt; items.size(); i++ ) {
        order.addItem( new Purchase( order, (Product) items.get( i ) ) );
    }

    //add the JFrame to the ApplicationData to allow for user interaction
    WorkingMemory workingMemory = ruleBase.newStatefulSession();
    workingMemory.setGlobal( "frame", frame );
    workingMemory.setGlobal( "textArea",  this.output );

    workingMemory.insert( new Product( "Gold Fish", 5 ) );
    workingMemory.insert( new Product( "Fish Tank", 25 ) );
    workingMemory.insert( new Product( "Fish Food",  2 ) );
    workingMemory.insert( new Product( "Fish Food Sample", 0 ) );            
           
    workingMemory.insert( order );
    workingMemory.fireAllRules();

    //returns the state of the cart
    return order.toString();
}
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>Two items get passed into this method; A handle to the JFrame
      Swing Component surrounding the output text frame (bottom of the GUI if
      / when you run the component). The second item is a list of order items;
      this comes from the TableModel the stores the information from the
      'Table' area at the top right section of the GUI.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis role="italic">for()</emphasis> loop transforms the
      list of order items coming from the GUI into the Order JavaBean (also
      contained in the PetStore.java file). Note that it would be possible to
      refer to the Swing dataset directly within the rules, but it is better
      coding practice to do it this way (using Simple Java Objects). It means
      that we are not tied to Swing if we wanted to transform the sample into
      a Web application.</para>

      <para>It is important to note that <emphasis role="bold">all state in
      this example is stored in the Swing components, and that the rules are
      effectively stateless. </emphasis>Each time the 'Checkout' button is
      pressed, this code copies the contents of the Swing
      <emphasis>TableModel</emphasis> into the Session / Working
      Memory.</para>

      <para>Within this code, there are nine calls to the working memory. The
      first of these creates a new workingMemory (statefulSession) from the
      Rulebase - remember that we passed in this Rulebase when we created the
      CheckoutCallBack class in the <emphasis role="italic">main()</emphasis>
      method. The next two calls pass in two objects that we will hold as Gl
      obal variables in the rules - the Swing text area and Swing frame that
      we will use for writing messages later.</para>

      <para>More inserts put information on products into the working memory,
      as well as the order list. The final call is the standard e <emphasis
      role="italic">fireAllRules()</emphasis>. Next, we look at what this
      method causes to happen within the Rules file.</para>

      <para>
        <example>
          <title>Package, Imports , Globals and Dialect - extract (1) from
          PetStore.drl</title>

          <programlisting>package org.drools.examples

import org.drools.WorkingMemory
import org.drools.examples.PetStore.Order
import org.drools.examples.PetStore.Purchase

import javax.swing.JFrame 
        
global JFrame frame 
global javax.swing.JTextArea textArea
 
dialect "mvel"
</programlisting>
        </example>
      </para>

      <para>The first part of the <emphasis
      role="italic">PetStore.drl</emphasis> file contains the standard package
      and import statement to make various Java classes available to the
      rules. We've seen the dialect been defaulted to "mvel" before in other
      examples. What is new are the two globals <emphasis>frame and textArea.
      </emphasis>These hold references to the Swing JFrame and Textarea
      components that were previous passed by the Java code calling the
      <emphasis>setGlobal() </emphasis>method. Unlike normal variables in
      Rules , which expire as soon as the rule has fired, Global variables
      retain their value for the lifetime of the (Stateful in this case)
      Session.</para>

      <para>The next extract (below) is from the <emphasis
      role="bold">end</emphasis> of the PetStore.drl file. It contains two
      functions that are referenced by the rules that we will look at
      shortly.</para>

      <para>
        <example>
          <title>Java Functions in the Rules - extract (2) from
          PetStore.drl</title>

          <programlisting>function void doCheckout(JFrame frame, WorkingMemory workingMemory) {
    Object[] options = {"Yes",
                        "No"};
                            
    int n = JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(frame,

    if (n == 0) {

function boolean requireTank(JFrame frame, WorkingMemory workingMemory, Order order, Product fishTank, int total) {
    Object[] options = {"Yes",
                        "No"};
                            
    int n = JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(frame,
                                         "Would you like to buy a tank for your " + total + " fish?",

    System.out.print( "SUGGESTION: Would you like to buy a tank for your "
                      + total + " fish? - " );

    if (n == 0) {
        Purchase purchase = new Purchase( order, fishTank );
        workingMemory.insert( purchase );
        order.addItem( purchase );
        System.out.println( "Yes" );
    } else {
        System.out.println( "No" );
    }      
    return true;
}
</programlisting>
        </example>
      </para>

      <para>Having these functions in the rules file makes the PetStore sample
      more compact - in real life you probably have the functions in a file of
      their own (within the same rules package), or as a static method on a
      standard Java class (and import them using the <emphasis
      role="bold">import function my.package.Foo.hello
      </emphasis>syntax).</para>

      <para>The above functions are</para>

            is set to the <emphasis role="italic">checkOut</emphasis>

            fire.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">requireTank()</emphasis> - Displays

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>We'll see later the rules that call these functions.The
      next set of examples are from the PetStore rules themselves. The first
      extract is the one that happens to fire first (partly because it has the
      <emphasis role="italic">auto-focus</emphasis> attibute set to
      true).<example>
          <title>Putting each (individual) item into working memory - extract
          (3) from PetStore.drl</title>

          <programlisting>// insert each item in the shopping cart into the Working Memory

</programlisting>
        </example></para>

      <para>This rule matches against all orders that do not yet have an
      Order.grossTotal calculated . It loops for each purchase item in that
      order. Some of the <emphasis role="italic">Explode Cart</emphasis> Rule
      should be familiar ; the rule name, the salience (suggesting of the
      order that the rules should be fired in) and the dialect set to
      <emphasis role="italic">java</emphasis>. There are three new

            only one rule in the group. However, nothing in Java code / nor a
            rule sets the focus to this group , so it relies on the next
            attibute for it's chance to fire.</para>

            <emphasis role="italic">evaluate</emphasis> agenda groups in turn
            , giving their rules a chance to fire. In practice , we loop
            through all items on the order, inserting them into memory, then
            firing the other rules after each insert.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>The next two listings shows the rules within the <emphasis

      role="italic">evaluate</emphasis> agenda groups. We look at them in the
      order that they are called.<example>

end
</programlisting>

      <para>The <emphasis role="italic">show items</emphasis> agenda-group has
      only one rule, also called <emphasis role="italic">Show Items</emphasis>
      (note the difference in case). For each purchase on the order currently
      in the working memory (session) it logs details to the text area (at the
      bottom of the GUI). The <emphasis role="italic">textArea</emphasis>
      variable used to do this is one of the Global Variables we looked at
      earlier.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis role="italic">evaluate</emphasis> Agenda group also
      gains focus from the <emphasis role="italic">explode cart
      </emphasis>rule above. This Agenda group has two rules (below) <emphasis

      <para>If the rule does fire, it calls the <emphasis
      role="italic">requireTank</emphasis>() function that we looked at
      earlier (showing a Dialog to the user, and adding a Tank to the order /
      working memory if confirmed). When calling the <emphasis
      role="italic">requireTank</emphasis>() function the rule passes the
      global <emphasis role="italic">frame</emphasis> variable so that the
      function has a handle to the Swing GUI.</para>

      <para>The next rule we look at is <emphasis role="italic">do

      <para>The <emphasis role="italic">do checkout</emphasis> rule has
      <emphasis role="bold">no agenda-group set and no auto-focus

      agenda-group - the same as the other non PetStore examples where agenda
      groups are not used. This group gets focus by default when all the
      rules/agenda-groups that explicity had focus set to them have run their
      course.</para>

      <para>There is no LHS to the rule, so the RHS will always call the
      <emphasis role="italic">doCheckout</emphasis>() function. When calling
      the <emphasis role="italic">doCheckout</emphasis>() function the rule
      passes the global <emphasis role="italic">frame</emphasis> variable so
      the function has a handle to the Swing GUI. As we saw earlier, the
      <emphasis role="italic">doCheckout</emphasis>() function shows a
      confirmation dialog to the user. If confirmed, the function sets the
      focus to the <emphasis role="italic">checkout</emphasis> agenda-group,
      allowing the next lot of rules to fire.</para>

    <title>Honest Politician Example</title>

    <para>The honest politician example demonstrates truth maintenance with
    logical assertions, the basic premise is that an object can only exist
    while a statement is true. A rule's consequence can logical insert an
    object with the insertLogical method, this means the object will only
    remain in the working memory as long as the rule that logically inserted
    it remains true, when the rule is no longer true the object is
    automatically retracted.</para>

    <para>In this example there is Politician class with a name and a boolean
    value for honest state, four politicians with honest state set to true are
    inserted.</para>

    <para><example>
        <title>Politician Class</title>

        <programlisting>public class Politician {
    private String name;
    private boolean honest;
    ...
}</programlisting>
      </example><example>
        <title>Honest Politician Example Execution</title>

        <programlisting>Politician blair  = new Politician("blair", true);
Politician bush  = new Politician("bush", true);
Politician chirac  = new Politician("chirac", true);
Politician schroder   = new Politician("schroder", true);
        
session.insert( blair );
session.insert( bush );
session.insert( chirac );
session.insert( schroder );

session.fireAllRules();</programlisting>
      </example>The console out shows that while there is atleast one honest
    polician democracy lives, however as each politician is in turn corrupted
    by an evil corporation, when all politicians are dishonest democracy is
    dead.<example>
        <title>Honest Politician Example Console Output</title>

        <programlisting>Hurrah!!! Democracy Lives
I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted schroder
I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted chirac
I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted bush
I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted blair
We are all Doomed!!! Democracy is Dead
</programlisting>
      </example>As soon as there is one ore more honest politcians in the
    working memory a new Hope object is logically asserted, this object will
    only exist while there is atleast one or more honest politicians, the
    moment all politicians are dishonest then the Hope object will be
    automatically retracted. This rule is given a salience of 10 to make sure
    it fires before any other rules, as at this stage the "Hope is Dead" rule
    is actually true.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Honest Politician Example : Rule "We have an honest
      politician"</title>

      <programlisting>rule "We have an honest Politician"
    salience 10
    when
        exists( Politician( honest == true ) )
    then
        insertLogical( new Hope() );
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>As soon as a Hope object exists the "Hope Lives" rule matches, and
    fires, it has a salience of 10 so that it takes priority over "Corrupt the
    Honest".</para>

    <example>
      <title>Honest Politician Example : Rule "Hope Lives"</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Hope Lives"
    salience 10
    when
        exists( Hope() )
    then
        System.out.println("Hurrah!!! Democracy Lives");
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Now that hope exists and we have, at the start, four honest
    politicians we have 4 activations for this rule all in conflict. This rule
    iterates over those rules firing each one in turn, corrupting each
    politician so that they are no longer honest. When all four politicians
    have been corrupted we have no politicians with the property "honest ==
    true" thus the rule "We hvae an honest Politician" is no longer true and
    the object it logical inserts "new Hope()" is automatically
    retracted.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Honest Politician Example : Rule "Corrupt the Honest"</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Corrupt the Honest"
    when
        politician : Politician( honest == true )   
        exists( Hope() )
    then
        System.out.println( "I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted " + politician.getName() );
        modify ( politician ) { honest = false };
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>With Hope being automatically retracted, via the truth maintenance
    system, then Hope no longer exists in the system and this rule will match
    and fire.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Honest Politician Example : Rule "Hope is Dead"</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Hope is Dead"
    when
        not( Hope() )
    then
        System.out.println( "We are all Doomed!!! Democracy is Dead" );
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>lets take a look the audit trail for this application:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Honest Politician Example Audit View</title>

          <imagedata fileref="honest_politician_audit.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The moment we insert the first politician we have two activations,
    the "We have an honest Politician" is activated only once for the first
    inserted politician because it uses an existential 'exists' conditional
    element which only matches. the rule "Hope is Dead" is also activated at
    this stage, because as of yet we have not inserted the Hope object. "We
    have an honest Politician" fires first, as it has a higher salience over
    "Hope is Dead" which inserts the Hope object, that action is highlighted
    green above. The insertion of the Hope object activates "Hope Lives" and
    de-activates "Hope is Dead", it also actives "Corrupt the Honest" for each
    inserted honested politician. "Rule Hope Lives" executes printing
    "Hurrah!!! Democracy Lives". Then for each politician the rule "Corrupt
    the Honest" fires printing "I'm an evil corporation and I have corrupted
    X", where X is the name of the politician, and modifies the politicians
    honest value to false. When the last honest polician is corrupted Hope is
    automatically retracted, by the truth maintenance system, as shown by the
    blue highlighted area. The green highlighted area shows the origin of the
    currently selected blue highlighted area. Once Hope is retracted "Hope is
    dead" activates and fires printing "We are all Doomed!!! Democracy is
    Dead".</para>

      <title>Sudoku Overview</title>

      <para>Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. The objective is
      to fill a 9x9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine
      3x3 zones contains the digits from 1 to 9 once and only once.</para>

      <para>The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid and the
      puzzle solver's task is to complete the grid with these
      constraints.</para>

      <para>The general strategy to solve the problem is to ensure that when
      you insert a new number it should be unique in that particular
      region(blocks) and also in that particular row and column.</para>

      <para>At the present time, the solving functionality has been achieved
      by the use of ten rules. This rule set could be extended to enable the
      engine to tackle more complex logic for filling grids such as
      this.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Java Source and Rules Overview</title>

      <para>The Java source code can be found in the
      /src/main/java/org/drools/examples/sudoku directory, with the two DRL
      files defining the rules located in the
      /src/main/rules/org/drools/examples/sudoku directory.</para>

      <para>org.drools.examples.sudoku.swing contains a set of classes which
      implement a framework for Sudoku puzzles. Note that this package does
      not have any dependencies on the Drools libraries. SudokuGridModel
      defines an interface which can be implemented to store a Sudoku puzzle
      as a 9x9 grid of Integer values, some of which may be null, indicating
      that the value for the cell has not yet been resolved. SudokuGridView is
      a Swing component which can visualise any implementation of
      SudokuGridModel. SudokuGridEvent and SudokuGridListener are used to
      communicate state changes between the model and the view, events are
      fired when a cell's value is resolved or changed. If you are familiar
      with the model-view-controller patterns in other Swing components such
      as JTable then this pattern should be familiar. SudokuGridSamples
      provides a number of partially filled Sudoku puzzles for demo
      purposes.</para>

      <para>org.drools.examples.sudoku.rules contains an implementation of
      SudokuGridModel which is based on Drools. Two POJOs are used, both of
      which extend AbstractCellValue and represent a value for a specific cell
      in the grid, including the row and column location of the cell, an index
      of the 3x3 zone the cell is contained in and the value of the cell.
      PossibleCellValue indicates that we do not currently know for sure what
      the value in a cell is. There can be 2-9 PossibleCellValues for a given
      cell. ResolvedCellValue indicates that we have determined what the value
      for a cell must be. There can only be 1 ResolvedCellValue for a given
      cell. DroolsSudokuGridModel implements SudokuGridModel and is
      responsible for converting an initial two dimensional array of partially
      specified cells into a set of CellValue POJOs, creating a working memory
      based on solverSudoku.drl and inserting the CellValue POJOs into the
      working memory. When the solve() method is called it calls
      fireAllRules() on this working memory to try to solve the puzzle.
      DroolsSudokuGridModel attaches a WorkingMemoryListener to the working
      memory, which allows it to be called back on insert() and retract()
      events as the puzzle is solved. When a new ResolvedCellValue is inserted
      into the working memory, this call back allows the implementation to
      fire a SudokuGridEvent to its SudokuGridListeners which can then update
      themselves in realtime. Once all the rules fired by the solver working
      memory have executed, DroolsSudokuGridModel runs a second set of rules,
      based on validatorSudoku.drl which works with the same set of POJOs to
      determine if the resulting grid is a valid and full solution.</para>

      <para>org.drools.examples.sudoku.Main implements a Java application
      which hooks the components desribed above together.</para>

      <para>org.drools.examples.sudoku contains two DRL files.
      solverSudoku.drl defines the rules which attempt to solve a Sudoku
      puzzle and validator.drl defines the rules which determin whether the
      current state of the working memory represents a valid solution. Both
      use PossibleCellValue and ResolvedCellValue POJOs as their facts and
      both output information to the console as their rules fire. In a
      real-world situation we would insert() logging information and use the
      WorkingMemoryListener to display this information to a user rather than
      use the console in this fashion.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Sudoku Validator Rules (validatorSudoku.drl)</title>

      <para>We start with the validator rules as this rule set is shorter and
      simpler than the solver rule set.</para>

      <para>The first rule simply checks that no PossibleCellValue objects
      remain in the working memory. Once the puzzle is solved, only
      ResolvedCellValue objects should be present, one for each cell.</para>

      <para>The other three rules each match all of the ResolvedCellValue
      objects and store them in thenew_remote_sitetes instance variable
      $resolved. They then look respectively for ResolvedCellValues that
      contain the same value and are located, respectively, in the same row,
      column or 3x3 zone. If these rules are fired they add a message to a
      global List of Strings describing the reason the solution is invalid.
      DroolsSudokoGridModel injects this List before it runs the rule set and
      checks whether it is empty or not having called fireAllRules(). If it is
      not empty then it prints all the Strings in the list and sets a flag to
      indicate that the Grid is not solved.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Sudoku Solving Rules (solverSudoku.drl)</title>

      <para>Now let us look at the more complex rule set used to solve Sudoku
      puzzles.</para>

      <para>Rule #1 is basically a "book-keeping" rule. Several of the other
      rules insert() ResolvedCellValues into the working memory at specific
      rows and columns once they have determined that a given cell must have a
      certain value. At this point, it is important to clear the working
      memory of any inserted PossibleCellValues at the same row and column
      with invalid values. This rule is therefore given a higher salience than
      the remaining rules to ensure that as soon as the LHS is true,
      activations for the rule move to the top of the agenda and are fired. In
      turn this prevents the spurious firing of other rules due to the
      combination of a ResolvedCellValue and one or more PossibleCellValues
      being present in the same cell. This rule also calls update() on the
      ResolvedCellValue, even though its value has not in fact been modified
      to ensure that Drools fires an event to any WorkingMemoryListeners
      attached to the working memory so that they can update themselves - in
      this case so that the GUI can display the new state of the grid.</para>

      <para>Rule #2 identifies cells in the grid which have only one possible
      value. The first line of the when caluse matches all of the
      PossibleCellValue objects in the working memory. The second line
      demonstrates a use of the not keyword. This rule will only fire if no
      other PossibleCellValue objects exist in the working memory at the same
      row and column but with a different value. When the rule fires, the
      single PossibleCellValue at the row and column is retracted from the
      working memory and is replaced by a new ResolvedCellValue at the same
      row and column with the same value.</para>

      <para>Rule #3 removes PossibleCellValues with a given value from a row
      when they have the same value as a ResolvedCellValue. In other words,
      when a cell is filled out with a resolved value, we need to remove the
      possibility of any other cell on the same row having this value. The
      first line of the when clause matches all ResolvedCellValue objects in
      the working memory. The second line matches PossibleCellValues which
      have both the same row and the same value as these ResolvedCellValue
      objects. If any are found, the rule activates and, when fired retracts
      the PossibleCellValue which can no longer be a solution for that
      cell.</para>

      <para>Rules #4 and #5 act in the same way as Rule #3 but check for
      redundant PossibleCellValues in a given column and a given zone of the
      grid as a ResolvedCellValue respectively.</para>

      <para>Rule #6 checks for the scenario where a possible cell value only
      appears once in a given row. The first line of the LHS matches against
      all PossibleCellValues in the working memory, storing the result in a
      number of local variables. The second line checks that no other
      PossibleCellValues with the same value exist on this row. The third to
      fifth lines check that there is not a ResolvedCellValue with the same
      value in the same zone, row or column so that this rule does not fire
      prematurely. Interestingly we could remove lines 3-5 and give rules
      #3,#4 and #5 a higher salience to make sure they always fired before
      rules #6,#7 and #8. When the rule fires, we know that $possible must
      represent the value for the cell so, as in Rule #2 we retract $possible
      and replace it with the equivalent, new ResolvedCellValue.</para>

      <para>Rules #7 and #8 act in the same way as Rule #2 but check for
      single PossibleCellValues in a given column and a given zone of the grid
      respectively.</para>

      <para>Rule #9 represents the most complex currently implemented rule.
      This rule implements the logic that, if we know that a pair of given
      values can only occur in two cells on a specific row, (for example we
      have determined the values of 4 and 6 can only appear in the first row
      in cells 0,3 and 0,5) and this pair of cells can not hold other values
      then, although we do not know which of the pair contains a four and
      which contains a six we know that the 4 and the 6 must be in these two
      cells and hence can remove the possibility of them occuring anywhere
      else in the same row (phew!). TODO: more detail here and I think the
      rule can be cleaned up in the DRL file before fully documenting
      it.</para>

      <para>Rules #10 and #11 act in the same way as Rule #9 but check for the
      existance of only two possible values in a given column and zone
      respectively.</para>

      <para>To solve harder grids, the rule set would need to be extended
      further with more complex rules that encapsulated more complex
      reasoning.</para>

      <title>Suggestions for Future Developments</title>

      <para>There are a number of ways in which this example could be
      developed. The reader is encouraged to consider these as
      excercises.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Agenda-group: agenda groups are a great declarative tool for
          phased execution. In this example, it is easy to see we have 2
          phases: "resolution" and "validation". Right now, they are executed
          by creating two separate rule bases, each for one "job". I think it
          would be better for us to define agenda-groups for all the rules,
          spliting them in "resolution" rules and "validation" rules, all
          loaded in a single rule base. The engine executes resolution and
          right after that, executes validation.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Auto-focus: auto focus is a great way of handling exceptions
          to the regular rules execution. In our case, if we detect an
          inconsistency, either in the input data or in the resolution rules,
          why should we spend time continuing the execution if it will be
          invalid anyway? I think it is better to simply (and immediatly)
          report the inconsistency as soon as it is found. To do that, since
          we now have a single rulebase with all rules, we simply need to
          define auto-focus attribute for all rules validating puzzle
          consistency.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Logical insert: an inconsistency only exists while wrong data
          is in the working memory. As so, we could state that the the
          validation rules logically insert inconsistencies and as soon as the
          offending data is retracted, the inconsistency no longer
          exists.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>session.iterateObjects(): although a valid use case having a
          global list to add the found problems, I think it would be more
          interesting to ask the stateful session by the desired list of
          problems, using session.iterateObjects( new ClassObjectFilter(
          Inconsistency.class ) ); Having the inconsistency class can also
          allow us to paint in RED the offending cells in the GUI.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>drools.halt(): even reporting the error as soon as it is
          found, we need a way to tell the engine to stop evaluating rules. We
          can do that creating a rule that in the presence of Inconsistencies,
          calls drools.halt() to stop evaluation.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>queries: looking at the method getPossibleCellValues(int row,
          int col) in DroolsSudokuGridModel, we see it iterating over all
          CellValues and looking for the few it wants. That, IMO, is a great
          opportunity to teach drools queries. We just define a query to
          return the objects we want and iterate over it. Clean and nice.
          Other queries may be defined as needed.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>session.iterateObjects(): although a valid use case having a
          global list to add the found problems, I think it would be more
          interesting to ask the stateful session by the desired list of
          problems, using session.iterateObjects( new ClassObjectFilter(
          Inconsistency.class ) ); Having the inconsistency class can also
          allow us to paint in RED the offending cells in the GUI.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Globals as services: the main objective of this change is to
          attend the next change I will propose, but it is nice by its own I
          guess. :) In order to teach the use of "globals" as services, it
          would be nice to setup a call back, so that each rule that finds the
          ResolvedCellValue for a given cell can call, to notify and update
          the corresponding cell in the GUI, providing immediate feedback for
          the user. Also, the last found cell could have its number painted in
          a different color to facilitate the identification of the rules
          conclusions.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Step by step execution: now that we have immediate user
          feedback, we can make use of the restricted run feature in drools.
          I.e., we could add a button in the GUI, so that the user clicks and
          causes the execution of a single rule, by calling fireAllRules( 1 ).
          This way, the user can see, step by step, what the engine is
          doing.</para>

      <title>Number Guess</title>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">Name:</emphasis> Number Guess 
<emphasis role="bold">Main class:</emphasis> org.drools.examples.NumberGuessExample
<emphasis role="bold">Type:</emphasis> java application
<emphasis role="bold">Rules file:</emphasis> NumberGuess.drl
<emphasis role="bold">Objective:</emphasis> Demonstrate use of Rule Flow to organise Rules
</programlisting>

      <para>The "Number Guess" example shows the use of RuleFlow, a way of
      controlling the order in which rules are fired. It uses widely
      understood workflow diagrams to make clear the order that groups of
      rules will be executed.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Creating the Number Guess RuleBase - extract 1 from
        NumberGuessExample.java main() method</title>

        <programlisting>final PackageBuilder builder = new PackageBuilder();

builder.addPackageFromDrl( new InputStreamReader( 
         ShoppingExample.class.getResourceAsStream( "NumberGuess.drl" ) ) );
builder.addRuleFlow( new InputStreamReader( 
         ShoppingExample.class.getResourceAsStream( "NumberGuess.rfm" ) ) );

final RuleBase ruleBase = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase();
ruleBase.addPackage( builder.getPackage() );

</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The creation of the package, and the loading of the rules (using
      the addPackageFromDrl() method ) is the same as the previous examples.
      There is a additional line to add the RuleFlow (NumberGuess.rfm) as you
      have the option of specifying different ruleflows for the same RuleBase.
      Otherwise the RuleBase is created in the same manner as before .</para>

      <example>
        <title>Starting the RuleFlow - extract 2 from NumberGuessExample.java
        main() method</title>

        <programlisting>final StatefulSession session = ruleBase.newStatefulSession();

session.insert( new GameRules( 100,  5 ) );
session.insert( new RandomNumber() );
session.insert( new Game() );

session.startProcess( "Number Guess" );
session.fireAllRules();

session.dispose();

</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>Once we have a RuleBase we can use it to obtain a stateful
      session. Into our session we insert our facts (standard Java Objects).
      For simplicity in this sample, these classes are all contained within
      our NumberGuessExample.java file. The GameRules class provides the
      maximum range and the number of guesses allowed. The RandomNumber class
      automatically generates a number between 0 and 100 and makes it
      available to our rules after insertion (via the getValue() method). The
      Game class keeps track of the guesses we have made before, and the
      number of guesses we have made.</para>

      <para>Note that before we call the standard fireAllRules() method, we
      also start the process that we loaded earlier (via the startProcess()
      method). We explain where to obtain the parameter we pass ("Number
      Guess" - the id of the ruleflow) when we talk about the RuleFlow file
      and the graphical RuleFlow editor below.</para>

      <para>Before we finish we our Java code , we note that In 'real life' we
      would examine the final state of the objects (e.g. how many guesses it
      took, so that we could add it to a high score table). For this example
      we are content to ensure the working memory session is cleared by
      calling the dispose() method.</para>

      <para>If you open the NumberGuess.rf file open in the Drools IDE (and
      have the JBoss Rules extensions installed correctly in Eclipse) you
      should see the above diagram, similar to a standard flowchart. Its icons
      are similar (but not exactly the same) as the JBoss jBPM workflow
      product. Should you wish to edit the diagram, a menu of available
      components should be available to the left of the diagram in the IDE,
      which is call the pallete. This diagram is saved in a (almost human)
      readable xml format, using xstream.</para>

      <para>If it is not already open, ensure the properties view is visible
      in the IDE. It can opened by selecting Window -&gt; Show View -&gt;
      Other and then select the Properties view. If you do this <emphasis
      role="bold">before</emphasis> you select any item on the RuleFlow (or
      click on blank space in the RuleFlow) you should be presented with the
      following set of properties.</para>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Keep an eye on the properties view as we progress through the
      example RuleFlow as it gives valuable information. In this case it
      provides us with the ID of the RuleFlow process that we used in our
      earlier code example when we called session.startprocess().</para>

      <para>To give an overview of each of the node types (boxes) in the
      NumberGuess RuleFlow.</para>

      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The Start and End nodes (green arrow and red box) are where
            the RuleFlow starts and ends.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>RuleFlowGroup (simple yellow box). These map to the
            RuleFlowGroups in our rules (DRL) file that we will look at later.
            For example when the flow reaches the 'Too High' RuleFlowGroup,
            only those rules marked with an attribute of <emphasis
            role="bold">ruleflow-group "Too High" </emphasis> can potentially
            fire.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Action Nodes (yellow box with cog like icon). These can
            perform standard Java method calls. Most action nodes in this
            example call System.out.println to give an indication to the user
            of what is going on.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Split and Join Nodes (Blue Ovals) such as "Guess Correct"
            and "More Guesses Join" where the flow of control can split
            (according to various conditions) and / or rejoin.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Arrows that indicate the flow between the various
            nodes.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>These various nodes work together with the Rules to make the
      Number Guess game work. For example, the "Guess" RuleFlowGroup allows
      only the rule "Get user Guess" to fire (details below) as only that Rule
      has a matching attribute of <emphasis role="bold">ruleflow-group
      "Guess"</emphasis></para>

      <example>
        <title>A Rule that will fire only a specific point in the RuleFlow -
        extract from NumberGuess.drl</title>

        <programlisting>rule "Get user Guess"
 ruleflow-group "Guess"
 no-loop
 when    
     $r : RandomNumber()
     rules : GameRules( allowed : allowedGuesses )
     game : Game( guessCount &lt; allowed )
     not ( Guess() )
 then
     System.out.println( "You have " + ( rules.allowedGuesses - game.guessCount ) 
     + " out of " + rules.allowedGuesses + " guesses left.\nPlease enter your guess 
     from 0 to " + rules.maxRange );
        br = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader( System.in ) );
        modify ( game ) { guessCount = game.guessCount + 1 }
        i = br.readLine();        
    insert( new Guess( i ) );
end</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The rest of this rule is fairly standard : The <emphasis
      role="bold">LHS (when)</emphasis> section of the rule states that it
      will be activated for each <emphasis>RandomNumber</emphasis> object
      inserted into the working memory where <emphasis>guessCount</emphasis>
      is less than the <emphasis>allowedGuesses</emphasis> ( read from the
      GameRules Class) and where the user has not guessed the correct
      number.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis role="bold">RHS (consequence, then)</emphasis>
      prints a message to the user, then awaits user input from
      <emphasis>System.in. </emphasis> After getting this input (as System.in
      blocks until the &lt;return&gt; key is pressed) it updates/modifes the
      guess count, the actual guess and makes both available in the working
      memory.</para>

      <para>The rest of the Rules file is fairly standard ; the package
      declares the dialect is set to MVEL, various Java classes are imported.
      In total, there are five rules in this file:</para>

      <para><orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Get User Guess, the Rule we examined above.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A Rule to record the highest guess.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A Rule to record the lowest guess.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A Rule to inspect the guess and retract it from memory if
            incorrect.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A Rule that notifies the user that all guesses have been
            used up.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>One point of integration between the standard Rules and
      the RuleFlow is via the 'ruleflow-group' attribute on the rules (as
      dicussed above). A <emphasis role="bold">second point of integration
      between the Rules File (drl) and the Rules Flow .rf files </emphasis>is
      that the Split Nodes (the blue ovals) can use values in working memory
      (as updated by the Rules) to decide which flow of action to take. To see
      how this works click on the "Guess Correct Node" ; then within the
      properties view, open the constraints editor (the button at the right
      that appears once you click on the 'Constraints' property line). You
      should see something similar to the Diagram below.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Click on 'Edit' beside 'To node Too High' and you see a dialog
      like the one below. The values in the 'Textual Editor' follow the
      standard Rule Format (LHS) and can refer to objects in working memory.
      The consequence (RHS) is that the flow of control follows this node
      (i.e. To node Too high') if the LHS expression evaluates to true.</para>

      </figure>

      <para>Since the NumberGuess.java example contains a main() method, it
      can be run as a standard Java application (either from the command line
      or via the IDE). A typical game might result in the interaction below
      (the numbers in bold are typed in by the user).</para>

      <para>Miss Manners is throwing a party and being the good host she wants
      to arrange good seating. Her initial design arranges everyone in male
      female pairs, but then she worries about people have things to talk
      about; what is a good host to do? So she decides to note the hobby of
      each guest so she can then arrange guests in not only male and female
      pairs but also ensure that a guest has someone to talk about a common
      hobby, from either their left or right side.</para>

        <para>Manners has become the de facto rule engine benchmark; however
        it's behavior is now well known and many engines optimize for this
        thus negating its usefulness as a benchmark which is why Waltz is

        <para>After the first Seating arrangement has been assigned a

        <title>The Data and Results</title>

        <para>Before going deeper into the rules lets first take a look at the
        asserted data and the resulting Seating arrangement. The data is a
        simple set of 5 guests who should be arranged in male/female pairs
        with common hobbies.</para>

        <para>Each line of the results list is printed per execution of the
        “Assign Seat” rule. They key bit to notice is that each line has pid
        one greater than the last, the significance of this will be explained
        in t he “Assign Seating” rule description. The 'l' and the 'r' refer
        to the left and right, 's' is sean and 'n' is the guest name. In my
        actual implementation I used longer notation, 'leftGuestName', but
        this is not practice in a printed article. I found the notation of
        left and right preferable to the original OPS5 '1' and '2</para>

        meant to exercise the cross product joins and agenda, many people not
        understanding this tweak the example to achieve better perfmance,
        making their use of the Manners benchmark pointless. Known cheats to
        Miss Manners are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Using arrays for a guests hobbies, instead of asserting each
            one as a single fact. This massively reduces the cross
            products.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The altering of the sequence of data can also reducing the
            amount of matching increase execution speed</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Changing NOT CE (conditional element) such that the test
            algorithm only uses the "first-best-match". Basically, changing
            the test algorithm to backward chaining. the results are only
            comparable to other backward chaining rule engines or ports of
            Manners.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Removing the context so the rule engine matches the guests
            and seats pre-maturely. A proper port will prevent facts from
            matching using the context start.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Any change which prevents the rule engine from performing
            combinatorial pattern matching</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>If no facts are retracted in the reasoning cycle, as a
            result of NOT CE, the port is incorrect.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Conflict Resolution</title>

        <para>Manners benchmark was written for OPS5 which has two conflict
        resolution strategies, LEX and MEA; LEX is a chain of several
        strategies including Salience, Recency, Complexity. The Recency part
        of the strategy drives the depth first (LIFO) firing order. The Clips
        manual documents the recency strategy as:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <attribution>Clips Reference Manual</attribution>

          <para>Every fact and instance is marked internally with a “time tag”
          to indicate its relative recency with respect to every other fact
          and instance in the system. The pattern entities associated with
          each rule activation are sorted in descending order for determining
          placement. An activation with a more recent pattern entities is
          placed before activations with less recent pattern entities. To
          determine the placement order of two activations, compare the sorted
          time tags of the two activations one by one starting with the
          largest time tags. The comparison should continue until one
          activation’s time tag is greater than the other activation’s
          corresponding time tag. The activation with the greater time tag is
          placed before the other activation on the agenda. If one activation
          has more pattern entities than the other activation and the compared
          time tags are all identical, then the activation with more time tags
          is placed before the other activation on the agenda.</para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>However Jess and Clips both use the Depth strategy, which is
        simpler and lighter, which Drools also adopted. The Clips manual
        documents the Depth strategy as:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <attribution>Clips Reference Manual</attribution>

          <para>Newly activated rules are placed above all rules of the same
          salience. For example, given that fact-a activates rule-1 and rule-2
          and fact-b activates rule-3 and rule-4, then if fact-a is asserted
          before fact-b, rule-3 and rule-4 will be above rule-1 and rule-2 on
          the agenda. However, the position of rule-1 relative to rule-2 and
          rule-3 relative to rule-4 will be arbitrary.</para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>The initial Drools implementation for the Depth strategy would
        not work for manners without the use of salience on the "make_path"
        rule, the Clips support team had this to say:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <attribution>Clips Support Forum</attribution>

          <para>The default conflict resolution strategy for CLIPS, depth, is
          different than the default conflict resolution strategy used by
          OPS5. Therefore if you directly translate an OPS5 program to CLIPS,
          but use the default depth conflict resolution strategy, you're only
          likely to get the correct behavior by coincidence. The lex and mea
          conflict resolution strategies are provided in CLIPS to allow you to
          quickly convert and correctly run an OPS5 program in CLIPS</para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>Investigation into the Clips code reveals there is undocumented
        functionality in the Depth strategy. There is an accumulated time tag
        used in this strategy; it's not an extensively fact by fact comparison
        as in the recency strategy, it simply adds the total of all the time
        tags for each activation and compares.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Assign First Seat</title>

        <para>Once the context is changed to START_UP Activations are created
        for all asserted Guests; because all Activations are created as the
        result of a single Working Memory action, they all have the same
        Activation time tag. The last asserted Guest would have a higher fact
        time tag and its Activation would fire, becuase it has the highest
        accumulated fact time tag. The execution order in this rule has little
        importance, but has a big impact in the rule "Assign Seat". The
        Activation fires and asserts the first Seating arrangement, a Path and
        then sets the Context's state to create Activation for "Assign
        Seat".</para>

        <programlisting>rule assignFirstSeat
    when
        context : Context( state == Context.START_UP )
        guest : Guest()
        count : Count()
    then
        String guestName = guest.getName();        

        insert( new Seating( count.getValue(), 1, true, 1, guestName, 1, guestName) );        
        insert( new Path( count.getValue(), 1, guestName ) );        

        count.setValue(  count.getValue() + 1 );        
        update( count );
        context.setState( Context.ASSIGN_SEATS );       
        update( context );
end</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Assign Seat</title>

        <para>This rule determines each of the Seating arrangements. The Rule
        creates cross product solutions for ALL asserted Seating arrangements
        against ALL the asserted guests; accept against itself or any already
        assigned Chosen solutions.</para>

        <programlisting>rule findSeating
   when 
       context : Context( state == Context.ASSIGN_SEATS )
       $s      : Seating( pathDone == true )
       $g1     : Guest( name == $s.rightGuestName )
       $g2     : Guest( sex != $g1.sex, hobby == $g1.hobby )
       count   : Count()
       not ( Path( id == $s.id, guestName == $g2.name) )
       not ( Chosen( id == $s.id, guestName == $g2.name, hobby == $g1.hobby) )
   then
       int rightSeat = $s.getRightSeat();
       int seatId = $s.getId();
       int countValue = count.getValue();
       
       insert( new Seating( countValue, seatId, false, rightSeat, $s.getRightGuestName(), rightSeat + 1, $g2.getName() ) );                                
       insert( new Path( countValue, rightSeat + 1, $g2.getName() ) );       
       insert( new Chosen( seatId, $g2.getName(), $g1.getHobby() ) );

       count.setValue(  countValue + 1 );
       update( count );       
       context.setState( Context.MAKE_PATH );
       update( context );
end</programlisting>

        <para>However, as can be seen from the printed results shown earlier,
        it is essential that only the Seating with the highest pid cross
        product be chosen – yet how can this be possible if we have
        Activations, of the same time tag, for nearly all existing Seating and
        Guests. For example on the third iteration of "Assing Seat" these are
        the produced Activations, remember this is from a very small data set
        and with larger data sets there would be many more possible Activated
        Seating solutions, with multiple solutions per pid:</para>

        <literallayout>=&gt;[ActivationCreated(35): rule=findSeating 
[fid:19:33]:[Seating id=3, pid=2, done=true, ls=2, ln=n4, rs=3, rn=n3] 
[fid:4:4]:[Guest name=n3, sex=m, hobbies=h3] 
[fid:3:3]:[Guest name=n2, sex=f, hobbies=h3]

=&gt;[ActivationCreated(35): rule=findSeating

[fid:9:9]:[Guest name=n5, sex=f, hobbies=h1] 
[fid:1:1]:[Guest name=n1, sex=m, hobbies=h1]</literallayout>

        <para>The creation of all these redundant Activations might seem
        pointless, but it must be remembered that Manners is not about good
        rule design; it's purposefully designed as a bad ruleset to fully
        stress test the cross product matching process and the agenda, which
        this clearly does. Notice that each Activation has the same time tag
        of 35, as they were all activated by the change in Context to
        ASSIGN_SEATS. With OPS5 and LEX it would correctly fire the Activation
        with the last asserted Seating. With Depth the accumulated fact time
        tag ensures the Activation with the last asserted Seating
        fires.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Make Path and Path Done</title>

        <para>"Make Path" must always fires before "Path Done". A Path is
        asserted for each Seating arrangement up to the last asserted Seating.
        Notice that "Path Done" is a subset of "Make Path", so how do we
        ensure that "Make Path" fires first?</para>

        <programlisting>rule makePath
    when 
        Context( state == Context.MAKE_PATH )
        Seating( seatingId:id, seatingPid:pid, pathDone == false )
        Path( id == seatingPid, pathGuestName:guestName, pathSeat:seat )
        not Path( id == seatingId, guestName == pathGuestName )
    then
        insert( new Path( seatingId, pathSeat, pathGuestName ) );
end</programlisting>

        <programlisting>rule pathDone
    when
        context : Context( state == Context.MAKE_PATH ) 
        seating : Seating( pathDone == false ) 
    then
        seating.setPathDone( true ); 
        update( seating );
        
        context.setState( Context.CHECK_DONE ); 
        update( context );
end</programlisting>

        <para>Both rules end up on the Agenda in conflict and with identical
        activation time tags, however the accumulate fact time tag is greater
        for "Make Path" so it gets priority.</para>

        <para>"Are We Done" only activates when the last seat is assigned, at

        "Make Path" always wins over "Path Done" "Are We Done" will take
        priority over "Continue".</para>

    is a famous cellular automaton conceived in the early 1970's by
    mathematician John Conway. While the system is well known as "Conway's
    Game Of Life", it really isn't a game at all. Conway's system is more like
    a life simulation. Don't be intimidated. The system is terribly simple and
    terribly interesting. Math and Computer Science students alike have
    marvelled over Conway's system for more than 30 years now. The application
    represented here is a Swing based implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
    The rules that govern the system are implemented as business rules using
    Drools. This document will explain the rules that drive the simulation and
    discuss the Drools specific parts of the implementation.</para>

    <para>We'll first introduce the grid view, shown below, to help
    visualisation of the problem; this is where the life simuation takes
    place. Initially the grid is empty, meaning that there are no live cells
    in the system; ech cell can be considered "LIVE" or "DEAD", live cells
    have a green ball in them. Pre-selected patterns of live cells can be
    selected from the "Pattern" drop down or cells can be doubled-clicked to
    toggle them between LIVE and DEAD. It's important to understand that each
    cell is related to it's neighbour cells, which is a core part of the
    game's rules and will be explained in a moment. Neighbors include not only
    cells to the left, right, top and bottom but also cells that are connected
    diagonally. Each cell has a total of 8 neighbors except the 4 corner cells
    and all of the other cells along the 4 edges. Corner cells have 3
    neighbors and other edge cells have 5 neighbors.</para>

    <para>So what are the basic rules that govern this game? Each generation,
    i.e. completion iteration and evalution of all cells, the system evolves
    and cells may be born or killed, there are a very simple set of rules that
    govern what the next generation will look like.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If a live cell has fewer than 2 live neighbors, it dies of
        loneliness</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If a live cell has more than 3 live neighbors, it dies from
        overcrowding</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If a dead cell has exactly 3 live neighbors, it comes to
        life</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>That is all there is to it. Any cell that doesn't meet any of those
    criteria is left as is for the next generation. With those simple rules in
    mind, go back and play with the system a little bit more and step through
    some generations one at a time and notice these rules taking their
    effect.</para>

    <para>The screnshot below shows an example generation, with a number of
    live cells. Don't worry about matching the exact patterns represented in
    the screen shot. Just get some groups of cells added to the grid. Once you
    have groups of live cells in the grid, or select a pre-designed pattern,
    click the "Next Generation" button and notice what happens. Some of the
    live cells are killed (the green ball disappears) and some dead cells come
    to life (a green ball appears). Cycle through several generations and see
    if you notice any patterns. If you click on the "Start" button, the system
    will evolve itself so you don't need to click the "Next Generation" button
    over and over. Play with the system a little and then come back here for
    more details of how the application works.</para>

    <para>Now lets delve into the code, as this is an advanced example we'll
    assume that by now you know your way around the Drools framework and able
    to connect many of the dots, so we'll just focus at a hgh level
    overview.The example has two ways to execute, one way uses AgendaGroups to
    manage execution flow the other uses RuleFlowGroups to manage execution
    flow - so it's a great way to see the differences. - that's
    ConwayAgendaGroupRun and ConwayRuleFlowGroupRun respectively. For this
    example I'll cover the ruleflow version, as its what most people will
    use.</para>

    <para>All the Cells are inserted into the session and the rules in the
    ruleflow-group "register neighbor" are allowed to execute by the ruleflow
    process. What this group of rules does is for each cell it registers the
    north east, north, north west and west cells using a Neighbor relation
    class, notice this relation is bi-drectional which is why we don't have to
    do any rules for southern facing cells. Note that the constraints make
    sure we stay one column back from the end and 1 row back from the top. By
    the time all activations have fired for these rules all cells are related
    to all their neighboring cells.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Conways Example : Register all Cell Neighbour relations</title>

      <programlisting>rule "register north east"
    ruleflow-group "register neighbor"
when
    CellGrid( $numberOfColumns : numberOfColumns )
    $cell: Cell( $row : row &gt; 0, $col : col &lt; ( $numberOfColumns - 1 ) )            
    $northEast : Cell( row  == ($row - 1), col == ( $col + 1 ) )    
then                    
    insert( new Neighbor( $cell, $northEast ) );
    insert( new Neighbor( $northEast, $cell ) );        
end

rule "register north"
    ruleflow-group "register neighbor"  
when
    $cell: Cell( $row : row &gt; 0, $col : col )   
    $north : Cell( row  == ($row - 1), col == $col )    
then        
    insert( new Neighbor( $cell, $north ) );
    insert( new Neighbor( $north, $cell ) );        
end

rule "register north west"
    ruleflow-group "register neighbor"
when
    $cell: Cell( $row : row &gt; 0, $col : col &gt; 0 )           
    $northWest : Cell( row  == ($row - 1), col == ( $col - 1 ) )                        
then        
    insert( new Neighbor( $cell, $northWest ) );
    insert( new Neighbor( $northWest, $cell ) );        
end

rule "register west"
    ruleflow-group "register neighbor"
when
    $cell: Cell( $row : row &gt;= 0, $col : col &gt; 0 )          
    $west : Cell( row  == $row, col == ( $col - 1 ) )                       
then        
    insert( new Neighbor( $cell, $west ) );
    insert( new Neighbor( $west, $cell ) );         
end</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Once all the cells are inserted some java code applies the pattern
    to the grid setting certain cells to Live. Then when the user clicks
    "start" or "next generation" it executes the "Generation" ruleflow. This
    ruleflow is responsible for the management of all changes of cells in each
    generation cycle.</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Conways Example : ruleflow "Generation"</title>

      <mediaobject>

          <imagedata fileref="conway_ruleflow_generation.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The ruleflow process first enters the "evaluate" group, this means
    any active rule in that group can fire. The rules in this group apply the
    main game of life rules discussed in the beginning of the example, where
    it determines what cells will be killed and which ones given life. We use
    the "phase" attribute to drives the reasoning of the Cell by specific
    groups of rules; typical the phase is tied to a RuleFlowGroup. in the
    ruleflow process definition. Notice that it doesn't actually change the
    state of any Cells at this point; this is because it's evaluating the Grid
    in turn and it must complete the full evaluation until those changes can
    be applied. To achieve this it sets the cell to a "phase" which is either
    Phase.KILL or Phase.BIRTH, which is used later to control actions applied
    to the Cell and when.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Conways Example : Evaluate Cells with state changes</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Kill The Lonely"
    ruleflow-group "evaluate"
    no-loop
when
#   A live cell has fewer than 2 live neighbors
    theCell: Cell(liveNeighbors &lt; 2, cellState == CellState.LIVE, phase == Phase.EVALUATE)
then
    theCell.setPhase(Phase.KILL);
    update( theCell );
end

rule "Kill The Overcrowded"
    ruleflow-group "evaluate"
    no-loop
when
#   A live cell has more than 3 live neighbors
    theCell: Cell(liveNeighbors &gt; 3, cellState == CellState.LIVE, phase == Phase.EVALUATE)
then
    theCell.setPhase(Phase.KILL);
    update( theCell );
end

rule "Give Birth"
    ruleflow-group "evaluate"
    no-loop
when
#   A dead cell has 3 live neighbors
    theCell: Cell(liveNeighbors == 3, cellState == CellState.DEAD, phase == Phase.EVALUATE)
then
    theCell.setPhase(Phase.BIRTH);
    update( theCell );
end
</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Once all Cells in the grid have been evaluated we first clear any
    calculation activations, that occured from any previous data changes, via
    the "reset calculate" rule, which clears any activations in the
    "calculate" group. We then enter a split which allows any activations in
    the "kill" groups and "birth" groups to fire, these rules are responsible
    for applying the state change.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Conways Example : Apply the state changes</title>

      <programlisting>rule "reset calculate"
    ruleflow-group "reset calculate"
when
then
    WorkingMemory wm = drools.getWorkingMemory();
    wm.clearRuleFlowGroup( "calculate" );
end

rule "kill"
    ruleflow-group "kill"
    no-loop
when
    theCell: Cell(phase == Phase.KILL)
then
    theCell.setCellState(CellState.DEAD);
    theCell.setPhase(Phase.DONE);   
    update( theCell );
end 
 
rule "birth"
    ruleflow-group "birth"
    no-loop
when
    theCell: Cell(phase == Phase.BIRTH)
then
    theCell.setCellState(CellState.LIVE);
    theCell.setPhase(Phase.DONE);
    update( theCell );  
end </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>At this stage a number of Cells have been modified with the state
    changed to either LIVE or DEAD, this is where we get to see the power of
    the Neighbour cell and relational programming. When a cell becomes LIVE or
    DEAD we use the Neigbor relation drive the iteration over all surrounding
    Cells increasing or decreasing the LIVE neighbour count, any cell who has
    their count changed is also set to to the EVALUATE phase, to make sure
    they are reasoned over duing the evaluate stage of the ruleflow process.
    Notice that we don't have to do any iteration ourselves, by simpy applying
    the relations in the rules we can get the rule engine to do all the hard
    work for us in a minimal amount of code - very nice :) Once the live count
    for all Cells has been determiend and set the ruleflow process comes to
    and end; the user can either tell it to evaluate another generation, of if
    "start" was clicked the engine will start the ruleflow process
    again.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Conways Example : Evaluate Cells with state changes</title>

      <programlisting>rule "Calculate Live"
    ruleflow-group "calculate"
    lock-on-active  
when
    theCell: Cell(cellState == CellState.LIVE)
    Neighbor(cell == theCell, $neighbor : neighbor) 
then
    $neighbor.setLiveNeighbors( $neighbor.getLiveNeighbors() + 1 );
    $neighbor.setPhase( Phase.EVALUATE );   
    update( $neighbor );
end 

rule "Calculate Dead"
    ruleflow-group "calculate"
    lock-on-active  
when
    theCell: Cell(cellState == CellState.DEAD)
    Neighbor(cell == theCell, $neighbor : neighbor )
then
    $neighbor.setLiveNeighbors( $neighbor.getLiveNeighbors() - 1 );
    $neighbor.setPhase( Phase.EVALUATE );
    update( $neighbor );    
end </programlisting>

      <title>BRMS editors</title>

      <para>The BRMS has many GUI editors, and textual editors. This discusses
      a few example rules using some of the GUI features:</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Guided editor</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="BRMS_Guided.png" format="PNG"
                       scalefit="2" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The above example shows the guided editor in action. This is a
      slightly more complex example, as a few bound variables are used. We are
      binding "$driver" to the Driver fact, and also binding driverId to the
      id field of the driver (which is then used in the SupplementalInfo fact
      - to join the driverId with the actual driver id). Note the use of the
      ruleflow-group to specify what step of the processing this rule applies
      to.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>DSL Editor</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The above shows the editor using a DSL. In this case the "guided
      editor" was used - this is not a text area, but only provides text boxes
      to "fill in the blanks" as specified in the DSL configuration. Note you
      can also use text based DSLs where there is not this restriction.</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management
      primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent loss. Insurance
      is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one
      entity to another, in exchange for a premium. Insurer, in economics, is
      the company that sells the insurance. Insurance rate is a factor used to
      determine the amount, called the premium, to be charged for a certain
      amount of insurance coverage. Risk management, the practice of
      appraising and controlling risk, has evolved as a discrete field of
      study and practice.</para>

      <title>The insurance logic</title>

      <para>If you have a poor driving record, you may need to look into high
      risk auto insurance. Accidents increase these rates as well. If you have
      a low experience for example less than 3 years as a licensed driver,
      insurance companies believe that the chances that you will be involved
      in a traffic accident are higher than someone more expert.</para>

      <para>Who you are also plays a factor. Men are considered more of a risk
      than women. Teens are considered more of a risk than adults as well if
      you have some younger driver in family like your 20 years old son.
      <programlisting>
rule "Young male single driver"
ruleflow-group "risk assessment"
when
 $driver : Driver( genre == Driver.MALE, age &lt; 25, maritalState == Driver.SINGLE )
then 
 $driver.updateInsuranceFactor(1.6);
end

rule "no expert driver"
ruleflow-group "risk assessment"
when
 $driver : Driver ( licenceYears &lt; 3 )
then
 $driver.updateInsuranceFactor(1.2);
end
</programlisting></para>

      <para>Extra coverage over glasses, additional car and accessories, like
      your expansive "pimped" sound system will increase your insurance final
      price, not the risk factor. <programlisting>
ruleflow-group "insurancecalcule"
salience 20
when
 not Rejection()
 $driver : Driver ( driverID : id )
 $access : AccessoriesCoverage ( driverId == driverID)
 $policy : Policy( approved == true )
then
 $policy.setInsurancePrice( $policy.getInsurancePrice() + 
  ($access.getAlarmSystemValue() * 0.10) + 
  ($access.getArmorValue() * 0.20) +
  ($access.getSoundSystemValue() * 0.30 ));
</programlisting></para>

      <para>This example uses the previously explained <emphasis
      role="bold">RuleFlow</emphasis> feature, the following diagram gives you
      an overview of the insurance factor and calculate logic: As you can see,
      we first calculate the insurance factor, if the driver matches with some
      rejection condition we don't execute the group that contains the Policy
      price calculus, just returning and not approved policy <para>
