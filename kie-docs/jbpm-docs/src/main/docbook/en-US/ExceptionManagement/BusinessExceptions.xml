    <title>Business Exceptions</title>
    
    <para>Business Exceptions are exceptions that are designed and managed in the BPMN2 specification of
      a business process. In other words, Business Exceptions are exceptions which happen at the process 
      or workflow level, and are not related to the technical components.</para>
    
    <para>Many of the elements in BPMN2 related to Business Exceptions are related to
      <emphasis>Compensation</emphasis> and <emphasis>Business Transactions</emphasis>. Compensation, in
      particular, is complexer than many other parts of the BPMN2 specfication.</para>
    
    <para>Full support for <emphasis>compensation</emphasis> and <emphasis>business
      transactions</emphasis> is expected with the release of jBPM 6.1 or 6.2. Once that has been
      implemented, this section will contain more information about using those BPMN2 features with 
      jBPM.</para>
    
    <section> 
      <title>Business Exceptions elements in BPMN2</title>
      
      <para>The following attempts to briefly describe Compensation and Business Transaction related 
        elements in BPMN2.  For more complete information about these elements and their uses, see 
        the BPMN2 specification, Bruce Silver's book <filename>BPMN Method and Style</filename> or any of 
        the other available books about the use of BPMN2.</para>

              <entry><para>Error Events can be used to signal when a process has encountered an unexpected

                  exception.</para>
                <para>Errors themselves can be extended with extra information that is passed from the 
                  throwing to catching event. This is done with the use of an Item Definition.</para>

        <entry><para>A Business Transaction in BPMN2 is a subprocess which can be used with
        <emphasis>compensation</emphasis>. Grouping activities in a Business Transaction lets the
        process designer easily add exception handling to specific activities in the 
        subprocess.</para>
        <para>Using a Business Transaction guarantees that all activities in the

        <para>When a Business Transaction is interrupted or otherwise not completed successfully, 
        there is a guarantee that all activities in the Business Transaction that have been initiated 
        will be compensated if compensating activities are defined for those activities.

                  Events</emphasis>.</para>
                <para>There are 3 types of compensation events: Intermediate (a.k.a. Boundary) (catch) events,
                  Start (catch) events, and Intermediate or End (throw) events.</para>
                <para>Compensation Boundary (catch) events may only be attached to activites (e.g. tasks) that could 
                  cause an exception. These Boundary events are then <emphasis>associated</emphasis> (not linked!)
                  with a Task that will be executed if the Boundary event catches a (thrown) Compensation signal.</para>
                <!-- add when Business Transactions have been implemented 
        If a Business Transaction fails, possibly because of the failure of one of the activities 
        inside it, then the activities associated with Boundary (catch) events will be triggered. 
        Only <emphasis>one</emphasis> activity or node may be associated with a Compensation Boundary
        Event!</para> -->
                <para>Start (catch) events are used when defining an <emphasis>Compensation Event SubProcess</emphasis>, 
                  which requires them in order to be able to catch a (thrown) Compensation signal. </para>
                <!-- add when Business Transactions have been implemented 
        Compensation Event SubProcesses are often used when a subprocess is needed to compensate for the Business
        Transaction as a whole (as opposed to defining compensating activities per node in the
        Business Transaction). This subprocess is triggered when a Business Transaction fails, just
        like activities attached to Compensation Boundary (catch) events.</para>
        -->
                <para>Compensation Intermediate and End events are used in order to throw Compensation Events. These events
                  often follow decision nodes that determine whether the workflow executed up to that point has 
                  succeeded. If not, the path including the Intermediate or End Event is chosen in order to trigger
                  Compensatoin for the activities that did not succeed.</para>  
                <!-- add when Business Transactions have been implemented
         Often, logic in the Business Transaction subprocesses will determine whether or not the Business Transaction 
         has succeeded or failed. If the subprocess has failed, then the process will proceed to an Intermediate or 
         End Compensation Event in order to trigger compensation for the Business Transaction subprocess.

      <para>BPMN2 contains a number of constructs to model exceptions in business processes. There are
        several advantages to doing exception handling at the business process level (as opposed to 
        handling it with code):
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><emphasis>Transparency</emphasis><itemizedlist>
            <listitem>Being able to quickly see what happens in exceptional situations means that 
              the results and performance of a process is more easily monitored and measured.</listitem>
            <listitem>It also increases how easily a process can be implemented as well as how 
              maintainable a process definition is.</listitem></itemizedlist>
          </listitem>
          <listitem><emphasis>Business Logic Isolation</emphasis><itemizedlist>
            <listitem>Again, the idea behind using a business process is to isolate the business logic 
              from the technical code. This simplifies the complexity of the system and increases how 
              quickly you can create new business processes and change existing ones.</listitem>
            <listitem>Implementing exception handling at a technical level often takes more time because
              it's often complexer and specific to a system.</listitem></itemizedlist>

      <title>Designing a workflow with Business Exceptions</title>
      
      <para>Where are business exceptions likely to occur? There is academic research on this, but some 
        possible examples are: 
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>When an interaction with an external party or 3rd party system does not go as planned</listitem>
          <listitem>When you can not fully check the the input data in your process (like a client's address information, 
            for example)</listitem>
          <listitem>In general, if there are parts of your process that are particularly dependent on one of the following, 
            a business exception will be a good idea: 
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>Company policy or policy governing certain (in-house) procedures</listitem> 
              <listitem>Laws governing the business process (such as age requirements, for example)</listitem>
