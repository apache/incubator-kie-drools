  <para>A package is a collection of rules and other related constructs, such
  as imports and globals. The package members are typically related to each
  other - perhaps HR rules, for instance. A package represents a namespace,
  which ideally is kept unique for a given grouping of rules. The package name
  itself is the namespace, and is not related to files or folders in any
  way.</para>

  <para>It is possible to assemble rules from multiple rule sources, and have
  one top level package configuration that all the rules are kept under (when
  the rules are assembled). Although, it is not possible to merge into the
  same package resources declared under different names. A single Rulebase,
  can though, contain multiple packages built on it. A common structure, is to
  have all the rules for a package in the same file as the package declaration
  (so that is it entirely self contained).</para>

  <para>The following railroad diagram shows all the components that may make
  up a package. Note that a package <emphasis>must</emphasis> have a namespace and be declared
  using standard Java conventions for package names; i.e., no spaces, unlike
  rule names which allow spaces. In terms of the order of elements, they can
  appear in any order in the rule file, with the exception of the "package"
  and "expander" statements being at the top of the file, before any rules
  appear. In all cases, the semicolons are optional.</para>

    <para>Import statements work like import statements in Java. You need to
    specify the fully qualified paths and type names for any objects you want
    to use in the rules. Drools automatically imports classes from the same
    named Java package and from the java.lang package.</para>

    <para>The expander statement (optional) is used to specify domain specific
    language (DSL) configurations (which are normally stored in a separate
    file). This provides clues to the parser how to understand what you are
    raving on about in your rules. It is important to note that in Drools 4.0
    (that is different from Drools 3.x) the expander declaration is mandatory
    for the tools to provide you context assistacnce and to avoid error reporting,
    but the API allows the program to apply DSL templates, even if the
    expanders are not declared in the source file.</para>

    <para>Globals are global variables. They are used to make application
    objects available to the rules, and are typically used to provide data or
    services that the rules use (specially application services used in rule
    consequences), to return data from the rules (like logs or values added in
    rules consequence) or for the rules to interact with the application doing
    callbacks. Globals are not inserted into the Working Memory so they should
    never be reasoned over; you should use them in rules' LHS only if the global has a
    constant immutable value. The engine cannot be notified about value
    changes of globals, and does not track their changes. Incorrect use
    of globals in constraints may yield
    surprising results - surprising in a bad way, like when a doctor says
    "thats interesting" to a chest XRay of yours.</para>

    <para>If multiple packages declare globals with the same identifier they
    must be of the same type and all of them will reference the same global
    value.</para>

    <para>In order to use globals you must:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Declare your global variable in your rules file and use it in
        rules. Example:</para>

        <programlisting>global java.util.List myGlobalList;

rule "Using a global"
when
    eval( true )
then
    myGlobalList.add( "Hello World" );
end
</programlisting>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Set the global value on your working memory. It is a best
        practice to set all global values before asserting any fact to the
        working memory. Example:</para>

        <programlisting>List list = new ArrayList();
WorkingMemory wm = rulebase.newStatefulSession();
wm.setGlobal( "myGlobalList", list );
</programlisting>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Note that these are just named instances of objects that you pass in
    from your application to the working memory. This means you can pass in
    any object you want: you could pass in a service locator, or perhaps a
    service itself. With the new 'from' element it is now common to pass a
    Hibernate session as a global, to allow 'from' to pull data from a named
    Hibernate query.</para>

    <para>One example may be an instance of a Email service. In your
    integration code that is calling the rule engine, you get your
    emailService object, and then set it in the working memory. In the DRL,
    you declare that you have a global of type EmailService, and give it a
    name "email". Then in your rule consequences, you can use things like
    email.sendSMS(number, message).</para>

    <para>Globals are not designed to share data between rules and they should
    never be used for that purpose. Rules always reason and react to the
    working memory state, so if you want to "share" data between rules, assert
    the data to the working memory.</para>

    <para>It is strongly discouraged to set (or change) a global value from
    inside your rules. We recommend to you always set the value from your
    application using the working memory interface.</para>
