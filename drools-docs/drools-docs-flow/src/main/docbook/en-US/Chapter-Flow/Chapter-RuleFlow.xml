  <para>A RuleFlow is a process that describes the order in which a series of steps need to
  be executed, using a flow chart.  A process consists of a collection of nodes that are
  linked to each other using connections.  Each of the nodes represents one step in the
  overall process while the connections specify how to transition from one node to the other.
  A large selection of predefined node types have been defined.  This chapter describes how
  to define such processes and use them in your application.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Creating a RuleFlow process</title>

    <para>Processes can be created by using one of the following three methods:
    <orderedlist>
       <listitem>Using the graphical RuleFlow editor in the Drools plug-in for Eclipse</listitem>
       <listitem>As an XML file, according to the XML process format as defined in the
       'drools-processes' XML Schema Definition.</listitem>
       <listitem>By directly creating a process using the Process API.</listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>Using the graphical RuleFlow editor</title>

      <para>The graphical RuleFlow editor is a editor that allows you to create a process
      by dragging and dropping different nodes on a canvas and editing the properties of these
      nodes.  The graphical RuleFlow editor is part of the Drools plug-in for Eclipse.  Once
      you have set up a Drools project (check the IDE chapter if you do not know how to do this),
      you can start adding processes.  When in a project, launch the 'New' wizard (use "Ctrl+N"
      or by right-clicking the directory you would like to put your ruleflow in and selecting
      "New ... -> Other ...".  Choose the section on "Drools" and then pick "RuleFlow file".
      This will create a new .rf file.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Creating a new RuleFlow file</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Next you will see the graphical ruleflow editor. Now would be a good time to
      switch to the "Drools Perspective" (if you haven't done so already) - this will tweak the UI so
      it is optimal for rules. Then ensure that you can see the "Properties" view down the bottom of
      the Eclipse window, as it will be necessary to fill in the different properties of the elements
      in your process.  If you cannot see the properties view, open it using the menu Window ->
      Show View -> Other ..., and under the General folder select the properties view.</para>

        <title>New RuleFlow process</title>

            <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Flow/NewRF.png" format="PNG" role="" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The RuleFlow editor consists of a palette, a canvas and an outline view.  To add
      new elements to the canvas, select the element you would like to create in the palette
      and then add them to the canvas by clicking on the preferred location.  For example, 
      click on the RuleFlowGroup icon in the Component Pallette of the GUI
      - you can then draw a few rule flow groups. Clicking on an element in your ruleflow 
      allows you to set the properties of that element.You can link the nodes together (as
      long as it is allowed by the different types of nodes) by using "Connection Creation"
      from the component palette.</para>

      <para>You can keep adding nodes and connections to your process until it represents the
      business logic that you want to specify.  You'll probably need to check the process for
      any missing information (by pressing the green "check" icon in the IDE menu bar) before
      trying to use it in your application.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Defining processes using XML</title>

      <para>It is also possible to specify processes using the underlying XML directly.  The
      syntax of these XML processes is defined using an XML Schema Definition. For example,
      the following XML fragment shows a simple process that contains a sequence of
      a start node, an action node that prints "Hello World" to the console, and an end node.</para>

<programlisting>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;process xmlns="http://drools.org/drools-5.0/process"
         xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xs:schemaLocation="http://drools.org/drools-5.0/process drools-processes-5.0.xsd"
         type="RuleFlow" name="ruleflow" id="com.sample.ruleflow" package-name="com.sample" &gt;

  &lt;header&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;nodes&gt;
    &lt;start id="1" name="Start" x="16" y="16" /&gt;
    &lt;actionNode id="2" name="Hello" x="128" y="16" &gt;
      &lt;action type="expression" dialect="mvel" &gt;System.out.println("Hello World");&lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;/actionNode&gt;
    &lt;end id="3" name="End" x="240" y="16" /&gt;
  &lt;/nodes&gt;

  &lt;connections&gt;
    &lt;connection from="1" to="2" /&gt;
    &lt;connection from="2" to="3" /&gt;
  &lt;/connections&gt;

&lt;/process&gt;
</programlisting>

      <para>The process XML file should consist of exactly one &lt;process&gt; element. This element
      contains parameters related to the process (the type, name, id and package name of the process),
      and consists of three main subsections: a &lt;header&gt; (where process-level information like variables,
      globals, imports and swimlanes can be defined), a &lt;nodes&gt; section that defines each of the nodes in
      the process (there is a specific element for each of the different node types that defines the
      various parameters and possibly sub-elements for that node type), and a &lt;connections&gt; section that
      contains the connections between all the nodes in the process.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Defining processes using the Process API</title>

      <para>While it is recommended to define processes using the graphical editor or the underlying XML (to
      shield yourself from internal APIs), it is also possible to define a process using the Process API directly.
      The most important process elements are defined in the org.drools.workflow.core and the
      org.drools.workflow.core.node packages.  A "fluent API" is provided that allows you to easily construct
      processes in a readable manner using factories.  At the end, you can validate the process that you were
      constructing manually. Some examples about how to build processes using this fluent API are added below.</para>


      <section>
        <title>Example 1</title>

      <para>This is a simple example of a basic process with a ruleset node only:
        <programlisting>
      RuleFlowProcessFactory factory =
          RuleFlowProcessFactory.createProcess("org.drools.HelloWorldRuleSet");
      factory
          // Header
          .name("HelloWorldRuleSet")
          .version("1.0")
          .packageName("org.drools")
          // Nodes
          .startNode(1).name("Start").done()
          .ruleSetNode(2)
              .name("RuleSet")
              .ruleFlowGroup("someGroup").done()
          .endNode(3).name("End").done()
          // Connections
          .connection(1, 2)
          .connection(2, 3);
      RuleFlowProcess process = factory.validate().getProcess();
        </programlisting>
      </para>
        
      <para>You can see that we start by calling the static createProcess() method
      from the RuleFlowProcessFactory class.  This method creates a new process
      with the given id and returns the RuleFlowProcessFactory that can be used to
      create the process.  A typical process consists of three parts: a header part
      that contains global elements like the name of the process, imports, variables,
      etc.  The nodes section contains all the different nodes that are part of the
      process and finally the connections section links these nodes to each other
      to create a flow chart.</para>

      <para>So in this example, the header contains the name and the version of the
      process and the package name. After that you can start adding nodes to the
      current process. If you have auto-completion you can see that you different
      methods to create each of the supported node types at your disposal.</para>

      <para>When you start adding nodes to the process, in this example by calling
      the startNode(), ruleSetNode() and endNode() methods, you can see that these
      methods return a specific NodeFactory, that allows you to set the properties
      of that node.  Once you have finished configuring that specific node, the
      done() method returns you to the current RuleFlowProcessFactory so you can add
      more nodes if necessary.</para>

      <para>When you finised adding nodes you must connect them by creating connections
      between them.  This can be done by calling the connection method, which will link
      the earlier created nodes.</para>

      <para>Finally, you can validate the generated process by calling the validate()
      method and retrieve the create RuleFlowProcess object.</para>

      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Example 2</title>

      <para>This example is using Split and Join nodes:
        <programlisting>
      RuleFlowProcessFactory factory =
          RuleFlowProcessFactory.createProcess("org.drools.HelloWorldJoinSplit");
      factory
          // Header
          .name("HelloWorldJoinSplit")
          .version("1.0")
          .packageName("org.drools")
          // Nodes
          .startNode(1).name("Start").done()
          .splitNode(2).name("Split").type(Split.TYPE_AND).done()
          .actionNode(3).name("Action 1").action("mvel", "System.out.println(\"Inside Action 1\")").done()
          .actionNode(4).name("Action 2").action("mvel", "System.out.println(\"Inside Action 2\")").done()
          .joinNode(5).type(Join.TYPE_AND).done()
          .endNode(6).name("End").done()
          // Connections
          .connection(1, 2)
          .connection(2, 3)
          .connection(2, 4)
          .connection(3, 5)
          .connection(4, 5)
          .connection(5, 6);
      RuleFlowProcess process = factory.validate().getProcess();
        </programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>This shows a simple split / join example.  As you can see, split nodes can have multiple outgoing
      connections and joins multipe incomming connections.  To understand the behaviour of the different types
      of split and join nodes, take a look at the documentation for each of these nodes.</para>

      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Example 3</title>

      <para>Now we show a more complex example with a ForEach node, where we have nested nodes:
        <programlisting>
      RuleFlowProcessFactory factory =
          RuleFlowProcessFactory.createProcess("org.drools.HelloWorldForeach");
      factory
          // Header
          .name("HelloWorldForeach")
          .version("1.0")
          .packageName("org.drools")
          // Nodes
          .startNode(1).name("Start").done()
          .forEachNode(2)
              // Properties
              .linkIncomingConnections(3)
              .linkOutgoingConnections(4)
              .collectionExpression("persons")
              .variable("child", new ObjectDataType("org.drools.Person"))
              // Nodes
              .actionNode(3)
                  .action("mvel", "System.out.println(\"inside action1\")").done()
              .actionNode(4)
                  .action("mvel", "System.out.println(\"inside action2\")").done()
              // Connections
              .connection(3, 4)
              .done()
          .endNode(5).name("End").done()
          // Connections
          .connection(1, 2)
          .connection(2, 5);
      RuleFlowProcess process = factory.validate().getProcess();
        </programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>Here you can see how we can include a ForEach node with nested action nodes.
      Note the linkIncommingConnections() and linkOutgoingConnections() methods that are
      called to link the foreach node with the internal action node. These methods are
      used to specify what the first and last nodes are inside the ForEach composite node.
      </para>

  <section>
    <title>Using a process in your application</title>

    <para>There are two things you need to do to be able to execute processes from
    within your application: (1) you need to create a knowledge base that contain
    the definition of the process; and (2) you need to start the process by creating
    a session to communicate with the process engine and start the process.</para>

    <orderedlist>

      <listitem><para><emphasis>Creating a knowledge base</emphasis>: Once you
      have a valid process, you can add the process to the knowledge base (note
      that this is almost identical to adding rules to the knowledge base, except
      for the type of knowledge added):</para>
      <programlisting>
KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
kbuilder.add(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("MyProcess.rf"), ResourceType.DRF);</programlisting>
      <para>After adding all your knowledge to the builder (you can add more than one
      process or even rules), you should probably check whether the process (and/or rules)
      have been parsed correctly and write out any errors like this:</para>
      <programlisting>
KnowledgeBuilderErrors errors = kbuilder.getErrors();
if (errors.size() > 0) {
    for (KnowledgeBuilderError error: errors) {
        System.err.println(error);
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Could not parse knowledge.");
}</programlisting>
      <para>Next you need to create the knowledge base that contains all the necessary
      processes (and rules) like this:</para>
      <programlisting>
KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase();
kbase.addKnowledgePackages(kbuilder.getKnowledgePackages());</programlisting>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para><emphasis>Starting a process</emphasis>: Processes are only executed
      if you explicitly state that they should be executed.  This is because you could
      potentially define a lot of processes in your knowledge base and the engine has no way
      to know when you would like to start each of these.  To activate a particular process,
      you will need to start the process by calling the startProcess method on your session.
      For example:
      <programlisting>
StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatefulKnowledgeSession();
ksession.startProcess("com.sample.MyProcess");</programlisting>
      The parameter of the startProcess method represents the id of the process that needs to
      be started (the process id needs to be specified as a property of the process, which are
      shown in the properties view when you click the background canvas of your process). 
      If your process also requires the execution of rules during the execution of the process,
      you also need to call the ksession.fireAllRules() method to make sure the rules are
      executed as well. That's it!</para>
      <para>You can also specify additional parameters that are used to pass on input data
      to the process, using the startProcess(String processId, Map parameters)
      method, that takes an additional set of parameters as name-value pairs.  These parameters
      are then copied to the newly created process instance as top-level variables of the process.
      </para>
      <para>You can also start a process from within a rule consequence, using
      <programlisting>kcontext.getKnowledgeRuntime().startProcess("com.sample.MyProcess");</programlisting>
      </para></listitem>

    </orderedlist>

    <orderedlist>

      <!-- START -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Start</emphasis>: The start of the ruleflow.  A ruleflow should have exactly one start node.  The start node cannot have incoming connections and should have one outgoing connection.  Whenever ruleflow process is started, the ruleflow will start executing here, and will then automatically continue to the first node linked to this start node, etc.  It contains the following properties:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para><emphasis>Id</emphasis>: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para><emphasis>Triggers</emphasis>: A start node can also specify additional triggers that can be used to automatically start the process.  Examples are a 'constraint' trigger that automatically starts the process if a given rule / contraint is satisfied, or an 'event' trigger that automatically starts the process if a specific event is signalled.</para></listitem>

      </listitem>

      <!-- END -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">End</emphasis>: The end of the ruleflow.  A ruleflow should have one or more end nodes.  The end node should have one incoming connection and cannot have outgoing connections.  It contains the following properties:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para><emphasis>Id</emphasis>: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para><emphasis>Name</emphasis>: The display name of the node.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para><emphasis>Terminate</emphasis>: An end node can be terminating (default) or not.  When a terminating end node is reached in the ruleflow, the ruleflow is terminated.  If a ruleflow is terminated, all nodes that are still active in this ruleflow are cancelled first (which is possible if parallel paths are used).  Non-terminating end nodes are simply end nodes in the process where the flow ends but other parallel paths still continue.</para></listitem>

      </listitem>

      <!-- RULESET -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">RuleFlowGroup</emphasis>: Represents a set of rules that need to be evaluated.  The rules are evaluated when the node is reached.  A RuleFlowGroup node should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.  Rules can become part of a specific ruleflow group using the "ruleflow-group" attribute in the header. When a RuleSet node is reached in the ruleflow, the engine will start executing rules that are part of the corresponding ruleflow-group (if any).  Execution will automatically continue to the next node if there are no more active rules in this ruleflow-group.  This means that, during the execution of a ruleflow-group, it is possible that new activations belonging to the currently active ruleflow-group are added to the agenda due to changes made to the facts by the other rules. Note that the ruleflow will immediately continue with the next node if it encounters a ruleflow-group where there are no active rules at that point.  If the ruleflow-group was already active, the ruleflow-group will remain active and exeution will only continue if all active rules of the ruleflow-group has been completed.  It contains the following properties:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para><emphasis>Id</emphasis>: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).</para></listitem>

      <!-- SPLIT -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Split</emphasis>: Allows you to create branches in your ruleflow.  A split node should have one incoming connection and two or more outgoing connections.  There are three types of splits currently supported:
          <itemizedlist>
           <listitem>
            <para>AND means that the control flow will continue in all outgoing connections simultaneously (paralellism).

           </listitem>
           <listitem>
             <para>XOR means that exactly one of the outgoing connections will be chosen (decision).  Which connection is decided by evaluating the constraints that are linked to each of the outgoing connections.  Constraints are specified using the same syntax as the left-hand side of a rule. The constraint with the lowest priority number that evaluates to true is selected.  Note that you should always make sure that at least one of the outgoing connections will evaluate to true at runtime (the ruleflow will throw an exception at runtime if it cannot find at least one outgoing connection).  For example, you could use a connection which is always true (default) with a high priority number to specify what should happen if none of the other connections can be taken.
             </para>
           </listitem>
           <listitem>
             <para>OR means that all outgoing connections whose condition evaluates to true are selected.  Conditions are similar to the XOR split, except that the priorities are not taken into account.  Note that you should make sure that at least one of the outgoing connections will evaluate to true at runtime (the ruleflow will throw an exception at runtime if it cannot find an outgoing connection).

      <!-- JOIN -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Join</emphasis>: Allows you to synchronize multiple branches.  A join node should have two or more incoming connections and one outgoing connection.  There are three types of splits currently supported:
          <itemizedlist>

           </listitem>
           <listitem>
             <para>Discriminator means that it continues if one of its incoming branches has been completed.  At that point, it will wait until all other connections have been triggered as well.  At that point, it will reset, so that it can trigger again when one of its incoming branches has been completed.

      <!-- EVENT WAIT -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Event wait (or milestone)</emphasis>: Represents a wait state.  An event wait should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.  It specifies a constraint which defines how long the process should wait in this state before continuing.  For example, a constraint in an order entry application might specify that the process should wait until no more errors are found in the given order.  Constraints are specified using the same syntax as the left-hand side of a rule.   When a wait node is reached in the ruleflow, the engine will check the associated constraint.  If the constraint evaluates to true directly, the flow will continue imediately.  Otherwise, the flow will continue if the constraint is satisfied later on, for example when a fact is inserted in, updated or removed from the working memory.  It contains the following properties:</para>
        <itemizedlist>

          <listitem><para><emphasis>Parameter in/out mapping</emphasis>: A SubFlow node can also define in- and out-mappings for variables.  The value of variables in this process with given variable name in the in-mappings will be used as parameters (with the associated parameter name) when starting the process.  The value of the variables in the sub-process with the given variable name in the out-mappings will be copied to the variables of this process when the sub-process has been completed.  Note that can only use out-mappings when "Wait for completion" is set to true.</para></listitem>

      <!-- ACTION -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Action</emphasis>: represents an action that should be executed in this ruleflow.  An action node should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.  The associated action specifies what should be executed.  An action should specify which dialect is used to specify the action (e.g. Java or MVEL), and the actual action code.  The action code can refer to any globals, the special 'drools' variable which implements KnowledgeHelper (can for example be used to access the working memory (drools.getWorkingMemory())) and the special 'context' variable which implements the ProcessContext (can for example be used to access the current ProcessInstance or NodeInstance and get/set variables). When an action node is reached in the ruleflow, it will execute the action and continue with the next node.  It contains the following properties:</para>

      <!-- TIMER -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Timer</emphasis>: represents a timer that can trigger one or multiple times after a given period of time.  A Timer node should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.  The timer delay specifies how long (in milliseconds) the timer should wait before triggering the first time.  The timerperiod specifies the time between two subsequenct triggers.  A period of 0 means that the timer should only be triggered once.  When a timer node is reached in the ruleflow, it will execute the associated timer.  The timer is cancelled if the timer node is cancelled (e.g. by completing or aborting the process).  Check out the section on timers to find out more information. The timer node contains the following properties:</para>

      <!-- FAULT -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Fault</emphasis>: A fault node can be used to signal an exceptional condition in the process.  A fault node should have one incoming connection and no outgoing connections.  When a fault node is reached in the ruleflow, it will throw a fault with the given name.  The process will search for an appropriate exception handler that is capable of handling this kind of fault.  If no fault handler is found, the process instance will be aborted.  It contains the following properties:</para>

      <!-- EVENT -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Event</emphasis>: An event node can be used to respond to (internal/external) events during the execution of the process.  An event node should have no incoming connections and one outgoing connection.  An event node specifies the type of event that is expected.  Whenever that type of event is detected, the node connected to this event node will be triggered.  It contains the following properties:</para>
        <itemizedlist>

      <!-- HUMAN TASK -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Human Task</emphasis>: Processes can also involve tasks that need to executed by human actors.  A task node represents an atomic task that needs to be executed by a human actor.  A human task node should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.  Human task nodes can be used in combination with swimlanes to assign multiple human tasks to similar actors. For more detail, check the 'human tasks' chapter.  A human task node is actually nothing more than a specific type of work item node (of type "Human Task").  A human task node contains the following properties:</para>

      <!-- COMPOSITE -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Composite</emphasis>: A composite node is a node that can contain other nodes (i.e. acts as a node container).  It thus allows creating a part of the flow embedded inside a composite node.  It also allows you to define additional variables and exception handlers that are accessible for all nodes inside this container. A composite node should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection. It contains the following properties:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para><emphasis>Id</emphasis>: The id of the node (which is unique within one node container).</para></listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">For Each</emphasis>: A for each node is a special kind of composite node that allows you to execute the contained flow multiple times, once for each element in a collection.  A for each node should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection. A for each node waits for completion of the embedded flow for each of its elements before continuing.  It contains the following properties:</para>

      <!-- WORK ITEMS -->
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Work Item</emphasis>: Represents an (abstract) unit of work that should be executed in this process.  All work that is executed outside the process engine should be represented (in a declarative way) using a work item.  Different types of work items are predefined, like for example sending an email, logging a message, etc.  However, the user can define domain-specific work items (using a unique name and by defining the paramaters (input) and results (output) that are associated with this type of work).  See the chapter about domain-specific processes for a detailed explanation and illustrative examples of how to define and use work items in your processes.  When a work item node is reached in the process, the associated work item is executed.  A work item node should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.</para>
        <itemizedlist>

Each type of work can define result parameters that will (potentially) be returned after the work item has been completed.  A result mapping can be used to copy the value of the given result parameter to the given variable in this process.  For example, the "FileFinder" work item returns a list of files that match the given search criteria as a result parameter 'Files'.  This list of files can then be bound to a process variable for use within the process. Upon completion of the work item, the values will be copied.  Note that can only use result mappings when "Wait for completion" is set to true.</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para><emphasis>Additional parameters</emphasis>: Each type of work item can define additional parameters that are relevant for that type of work.  For example, the "Email" work item defines additional parameters like 'From', 'To', 'Subject' and 'Body'.  The user can either fill in values for these parameters directly, or define a parameter mapping that will copy the value of the given variable in this process to the given parameter (if both are specified, the mapping will have precedence).  Parameters of type String can use #{expression} to embed a value in the String.  The value will be retrieved when creating the work item and the #{...} will be replaced by the toString() value of the variable.  The expression could simply be the name of a variable (in which case it will be resolved to the value of the variable), but more advanced MVEL expressions are possible as well, like #{person.name.firstname}.</para></listitem>

  <section>
    <title>Data</title>

    <para>While the flow graph focusses on specifying the control flow of the process, it is usually also
    necessary to look at the process from a data perspective.  During the execution of a process, data
    can retrieved, stored, passed on and (re)used throughout the entire process.
    </para>

    <para>Runtime data can be stored during the execution of the process using variables.  A variable is defined
    by a name and a data type.  This could be a basic data types (e.g. boolean, integer, String) or any kind of
    Object.  Variables can be defined inside a variable scope.  The top-level scope is the variable scope of the
    process itself.  Sub-scopes can be defined using a composite node.  Variables that are defined in a sub-scope
    are only accessible for nodes within that scope.</para>

    <para>Whenever a variable is accessed, the process will search for the appropriate variable scope that defines
    the variable.  Nesting of variable scopes is allowed: a node will always search for a variable in its
    parent container.  If the variable cannot be found, it will look in that one's parent container, etc. until the
    process instance itself is reached.  If the variable cannot be found, either null will be returned (in case of
    a read) or an error message will be shown that the variable could not be found (in case of a write), after which
    the process will continue without setting the paramater.</para>

    <para>Variables can be used in various ways:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>Process-level variables can be set when starting a process by providing a map of parameters when
        invoking the startProcess method.  These parameters will be set as variables on the process scope.</listitem>
        <listitem>Actions can access variables directly (by simply using the name of the variable as a parameter name).
          <programlisting>person.setAge(10); // with "person" a variable in the process</programlisting>
          Changing the value of a variable can be done through the knowledge context:
          <programlisting>kcontext.setVariable(variableName, value);</programlisting>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>Work items and sub-flows can pass the value of parameters to the outside world by mapping the variable to one
        of the work item parameters (either using a parameter mapping or by using #{expression} directly inside
        a String parameter.  The results of a work item can also be copied to a variable using a result mapping.</listitem>
        <listitem>Various other nodes can also access data.  For example, event nodes can store the data associated
        to the event in a variable, exception handlers can read error data from a specific variable, etc.  Check the
        properties of the different node types for more information.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>Finally, processes and rules all have access to globals (globally defined variables that are considered immutable
    with regard to rule evaluation) and data in the knowledge session.  The knowledge session can be accessed in actions
    using the knowledge context:</para>
    <programlisting>kcontext.getKnowledgeRuntime().insert( new Person("..") );</programlisting>

    <para>Constraints can be used in various locations in your processes, like for example decision points (i.e. an (X)OR split), wait constraints, etc.  Drools Flow supports two types of constraints:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>code: Code constraints are expressions that return a boolean value.  They are evaluated directly whenever they are reached.  We currently support two dialects for expressing these code constraints: java and MVEL.  Both java and MVEL code constraints have direct access to the globals and variables defined in the process.  An example of a valid java code constraint would for example be (with person a variable in the process):
          <programlisting>return person.getAge() > 20;</programlisting>
An similar example of a valid MVEL code constraint would be:
          <programlisting>return person.age > 20;</programlisting>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>rule: Rule constraints are equals to normal Drools rule conditions.  They use the Drools Rule Language syntax to express possibly complex constraints.  These rules can (like any other rule) refer to data in the working memory.  They can also refer to globals directly.  An example of a valid rule constraint would for example be:
          <programlisting>Person( age > 20 )</programlisting>
which will search for a person older than 20 in the working memory.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>Rule constraints do not have direct access to variables defined inside the process.  It is however possible to refer to the current process instance inside a rule constraint, by adding the process instance to the working memory and matching to the process instance inside your rule constraint.  We have added special logic to make sure that a variable "processInstance" of type WorkflowProcessInstance will only match to the current process instance and not to other process instances in the working memory.  Note that you are however responsible yourself to insert (and possibly update) the process instance into the session (for example using Java code or an (on-entry or on-exit or explicit) action in your process). The following exampleof a rule constraint will search for a person with the same name as the value stored in the variable "name" of the process:</para>

    <programlisting>processInstance: WorkflowProcessInstance()
Person( name == ( processInstance.getVariable("name") ) )
# add more constraints here ...</programlisting>

  <section>
    <title>Actions</title>

    <para>Actions can be used in different ways:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>Action node</listitem>
        <listitem>On entry/exit actions</listitem>
        <listitem>Actions that specify the behaviour of exception handlers</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>Actions have access to globals and the variables that are defined for the process and the 'kcontext' variable.  This variable is of type org.drools.runtime.process.ProcessContext and can be used for
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>Getting the current node instance (if applicable).  The node instance could be queried for data (name, type).  You can also cancel the current node instance.</listitem>
        <listitem>Getting the current process instance.  This process instance could be queried for data (name, id, processId, etc.), abort process instance, signal events (internal).</listitem>
        <listitem>Data: getting or setting the value of variables</listitem>
        <listitem>Accessing the KnowledgeRuntime: this allows you do things like starting a process, signalling events (external), inserting data, etc.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>Drools currently supports two dialects: the java and the MVEL dialect.  Java actions should be valid Java code.  MVEL actions can use the business scripting language MVEL to express the action.  MVEL accepts any valid Java code but also provides aditional support for nested accesses of parameters (e.g. person.name instead of person.getName()), and many other scripting improvements.  Therefore, MVEL usually allows more business user friendly action expressions.  For example, an action that prints out the name of the person in the "requester" variable of the process would look like this:</para>

    <programlisting>// using the Java dialect
System.out.println( person.getName() );

// Similarly, using the MVEL dialect
System.out.println( person.name );
    </programlisting>

    <title>Events</title>

        <figure>
          <title>A sample process using events</title>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>              <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Flow/EventProcess.png" format="PNG" role="" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

    <para>During the execution of a process, the process engine makes sure that all the relevant
    tasks are executed according to the process plan, by requesting the execution of work items
    and waiting for the results.  However, it is also possible that the process should respond to
    events that were not directly requested by the process engine.  Explicitly representing these
    events in a process allows the process author to specify how the process should react whenever
    such events occur.</para>

    <para>Events have a type and possibly data associated with the event.  Users are free to define
    their own types of events and the data that is associated with this event.
    </para>

    <para>A process can specify how to respond to events by using event nodes.  An event node needs
    to specify the type of event the node is interested in.  It can also define a variable name, which
    defines the variable that the data that is associated with the event will be copied to.  This allows
    subsequent nodes in the process to access the event data and take appropriate action based on this
    data.</para>

    <para>An event can be signalled to a running instance of a process in a number of ways:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>Internal event: Any action inside a process (e.g. the action of an action node,
        or on-entry or on-exit actions of nodes) can signal the occurence of an internal event to
        the surrounding process instance using
        <programlisting>context.getProcessInstance().signalEvent(type, eventData);</programlisting></listitem>
        <listitem>External event: A process instance can be notified of an event from outside using
        <programlisting>processInstance.signalEvent(type, eventData);</programlisting></listitem>
        <listitem>External event using event correlation: Instead of notifying a process instance directly,
        it is also possible to have the engine automatically determine which process instances might be interested
        in an event using event correlation (based on the event type).  All process instances that have specified
        they are interested in receiving external events of that type (e.g. by having an event node that is
        listening to external events of that type) will be notified. You can signal such
        an event to the process engine using
        <programlisting>workingMemory.signalEvent(type, eventData);</programlisting></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>Events could also be used to start a process.  Whenever a start node defines an event trigger of a
    specific type, a new process instance will be started every time that type of event is signalled to the
    process engine.
    </para>

    <title>Exceptions</title>

        <figure>
          <title>A sample process using exception handlers</title>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Flow/FaultProcess.png" format="PNG" role="" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

    <para>Whenever an exceptional condition occurs during the execution of a process, a fault could be raised
    to signal the occurrence of this exception.  The process will then search for an appropriate exception handler
    that is capable of handling such a fault.</para>

    <para>Similar to events, faults also have a type and possibly data associated with the fault.  Users are free to define
    their own types of faults and the data that is associated with this fault.</para>

    <para>Faults can be created using a fault node: A fault node generates a fault of the given type (i.e. the fault name).
    If the fault node specifies a fault variable, the value of the given variable will be associated with the fault.</para>

    <para>Whenever a fault is created, the process will search for an appropriate exception handler that is capable
    of handling the given type of fault.  Processes and composite nodes both can define exception handlers for handling
    faults.  Nesting of exception handlers is allowed: a node will always search for an appropriate exception handler in its
    parent container.  If none is found, it will look in that one's parent container, etc. until the process instance
    itself is reached.  If no exception handler can be found, the process instance will be aborted, resulting in the cancellation
    of all nodes inside the process.</para>

    <para>Exception handlers can also specify a fault variable.  The data associated with the fault (if any) will be copied
    to this variable if the exception handler is selected to handle the fault.  This allows subsequent actions / nodes in the
    process to access the fault data and take appropriate action based on this data.</para>

    <para>Exception handlers need to define an action that specifies how to respond to the given fault.  In most cases, the
    behaviour that is needed to react to the given fault cannot be handled in one action.  It is therefore recommended
    to have the exception handler signal an event of a specific type (in this case "Fault") using
    <programlisting>context.getProcessInstance().signalEvent("FaultType", context.getVariable("FaultVariable");</programlisting>
    </para>

  <section>
    <title>Timers</title>

    <para>Timers can be used to wait for a predefined amount of time, before
    triggering.  They could be used to specify timeout behaviour, to trigger
    certain logic after a certain period or repeat it at regular intervals.</para>

    <para>A timer needs to specify a delay and a period.  The delay specifies the
    amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait after activation before triggering the
    timer the first time.  The period defines the time between subsequent activations.
    If the period is 0, the timer will only be triggered once.</para>

    <para>The timer service is responsible for making sure that timers get triggered
    at the appropriate times.  Timers can also be cancelled, meaning that the timer
    will no longer be triggered.</para>

    <para>Timers can be used in two ways inside a process:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>TimerNode: A timer node is a node that can be added to the process flow.
        When the timer node is triggered, the associated timer is activated.  The timer node
        will trigger the next node whenever the timer is triggered.  This means that the
        outgoing connection of a timer node can be triggered multiple times if a period is used.
        Cancelling a timer node also cancels the associated timer.</listitem>
        <listitem>Timers associated to nodes: it is also possible to add timers to event-based
        nodes like work items, sub-flows, etc.  The timers associated with these nodes are activated
        once the node is triggered.  The associated action is executed if the timer is triggered.
        This could for example be used to send out notifications at regular time intervals when
        the execution of a task takes too long, or signal an event or a fault in case of a time-out.
        When the node these timers are defined for is completed, the timers are automatically
        cancelled.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>By default, the Drools engine is a passive component, meaning that it will only
    start processing if you tell it to (for example, you first insert the necessary data and then
    tell the engine to start processing).  In passive mode, a timer that has been triggered will
    be put on the action queue.  This means that it will be executed the next time the engine is
    told to start executing by the user (using fireAllRules() or if the engine is already / still
    running), in which case the timer will be executed automatically.</para>

    <para>When using timers, it does usually make sense to make the Drools engine an active component,
    meaning that it will execute actions whenever they become available (and not wait until the user
    tells it to start executing again).  This would mean a timer would be executed once it is triggered.
    To make the engine fire all actions continuously, you must call the fireUntilHalt() method.  That
    means the engine will continue firing until the engine is halted.  The following fragment shows
    how to do this (note that you should call fireUntilHalt() in a separate thread as it will only return
    if the engine has been halted (by either the user or some logic calling halt() on the session):</para>

    <programlisting>
new Thread(new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    ksession.fireUntilHalt();
  }
}).start();

// starting a new process instance
ksession.startProcess("...");
// any timer that will trigger will now be executed automatically</programlisting>

    <title>Assigning rules to a ruleflow group</title>

  <para>Drools already provides some functionality to define the order in
  which rules should be executed, like salience, activation groups, etc. When
  dealing with (possibly a lot of) large rule-sets, managing the order in
  which rules are evaluated might become complex. Ruleflow allows you to
  specify the order in which rule sets should be evaluated by using a flow
  chart. This allows you to define which rule sets should be evaluated in
  sequence or in parallel, to specify conditions under which rule sets should
  be evaluated, etc. This chapter contains a few ruleflow examples.</para>

  <para>A rule flow is a graphical description of a sequence of steps that the
  rule engine needs to take, where the order is important. The ruleflow can
  also deal with conditional branching, parallelism, synchonization, etc.</para>

  <para>To use a ruleflow to describe the order in which rules should be
  evaluatied, you should first group rules into rulefow-groups using the ruleflow-group
  rule attribute ("options" in the GUI).  Then you should create a ruleflow 
  graph (which is a flow chart) that graphically describe the order in which the rules
  should be considered (by specifying the order in which the ruleflow-groups should
  be evaluated).</para>

    <programlisting>
  rule 'YourRule'
     ruleflow-group 'group1'
     when
      ...
     then
      ...
    end  
  </programlisting>

    <para>This rule will then be placed in the ruleflow-group called "group1".</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>A simple ruleflow</title>

    <figure>
      <title>Ruleflow</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
		<imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Flow/RuleFlowSimple.png" format="PNG"
                     role="" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The above rule flow specifies that the rules in the group "Check Order" must be
    executed before the rules in the group "Process Order". This means that only
    rules which are marked as having a ruleflow-group of "Check Order" will be
    considered first, and then "Process Order". That's about it. You could
    achieve similar results with either using salience (setting priorities, but this
    is harder to maintain, and makes the time-relationship implicit in the
    rules), or agenda groups. However, using a ruleflow makes the order of
    processing explicit, almost like a meta-rule, and makes managing more complex
    situations a lot easier.</para>

    <para>In practice, if you are using ruleflow, you will most likely be
    doing more then setting a simple sequence of groups to progress though.
    You are more likely modeling branches of processing. In this case you use
    "Split" and "Join" items from the component pallette. You use connections
    to connect from the start to ruleflow groups, or to Splits, and from
    splits to groups, joins etc. (i.e. basically like a simple flow chart that
    models your processing). You can work entirely graphically until you get
    the graph approximately right.</para>

    <figure>

    </figure>

    <para>The above flow is a more complex example. This example is an
    insurance claim processing rule flow. A description: Initially the claim
    data validation rules are processed (these check for data integrity and
    consistency, that all the information is there). Next there is a decision
    "split" - based on a condition which the rule flow checks (the value of
    the claim), it will either move on to an "auto-settlement" group, or to
    another "split", which checks if there was a fatality in the claim. If
    there was a fatality then it determines if the "regular" of fatality
    specific rules will take effect. And so on. What you can see from this is
    based on a few conditions in the rule flow the steps that the processing
    takes can be very different. Note that all the rules can be in one package
    - making maintenance easy. You can separate out the flow control from the
    actual rules.</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Split types (referring to the above): When you click on a split, you
    will see the above properties panel. You then have to choose the type:
    AND, OR, and XOR. The interesting ones are OR and XOR: if you choose OR,
    then any of the "outputs" of the split can happen (i.e. processing can
    proceed in parallel down more then one path). If you chose XOR, then it
    will be only one path.</para>

    <para>If you choose OR or XOR, then in the row that has constraints, you
    will see a button on the right hand side that has "..." - click on this,
    and you will see the constraint editor. From this constraint editor, you
    set the conditions which the split will use to decide which "output path"
    will be chosen.</para>

    <para>Choose the output path you want to set the constraints for (eg

    editor:</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>This is a text editor where the constraints (which are like the
    condition part of a rule) are entered. These constraints operate on facts
    in the working memory (eg. in the above example, it is checking for claims
    with a value of less than 250). Should this condition be true, then the
    path specified by it will be followed.</para>

    <title>Using old Drools 4.x RuleFlow processes</title>

    <para>The XML format that was used in Drools4 to store RuleFlow processes
    was an automatically generated XML file generated by XStream.  As a result,
    it was hard to read by human actors and hard to maintain and extend.  The
    new Drools Flow XML format has been created to simplify this.  This however
    means that, by default, old RuleFlow processes cannot simply be executed on
    the Drools5 engine.</para>

    <para>We do however provide a RuleFlowMigrator that allows you to transform
    your old .rf file to the new format.  It uses an XSLT transformation to 
    generate the new XML based on the old content.  You can use this class to
    manually transform your old processes to the new format once when upgrading
    from Drools4.x to Drools5.x.  You can however also let the KnowledgeBuilder
    to automatically upgrade your processes when to the new format when they are
    loaded into the knowledge base.  While this requires a conversion every time
    the process is loaded into the knowledge base, it does however support a more
    seamless upgrade.  To support this automatic upgrade, you need to set the 
    "drools.ruleflow.port" system property to "true", for example by adding
    -Ddrools.ruleflow.port=true when starting your application or by calling
    System.setProperty("drools.ruleflow.port", "true");</para>

    <para>The Drools Eclipse plugin also automatically detects if an old RuleFlow
    file is opened.  At that point, it will automatically perform the conversion
    and show the result in the graphical editor.  You then need to save this result
    (either in a new file or by overriding the old one) to persist the old process
    in the new format.  Note that the plugin does not support editing and saving
    processes in the old Drools4.x format.</para>
