  and bug fixes (done over the last few months on top of 6.0.1.Final), and also includes some
  important new features, adding on top of the foundation devilered as part of jBPM 6.0. <section>

    <title>Deployment descriptors</title>
    <para>Deployment descriptors have been added as an optional, yet powerful way of configuring
      deployment units - kjars. Deployment descriptors allow to configure (among others)</para>

    <title>Role-based authorization at runtime for process definitions and process instances</title>
    <para>The process definition and process instance view in the jbpm console now also take the
      role-based access control restrictions into account that can be defined on the project the
      process is defined in. You can limit the visibility of a project (or repository as a whole) by
      associating some roles with it that are required to be able to see the project (or
      repository). This can be done when creating the repository, or bu using the command line
      interface to connect to the execution server. The deployment descriptor (see previous section)
      also allows you to further customize these roles at deployment time. At runtime, the views
      will check if the current logged in user has one of the necessary roles to be able to see that
      process. If not, the user will not see this process or process instance in the process
      definition or process instance list respectively. </para>

    <title>jBPM Spring integration</title>
    <para>Spring integration has been improved to allow complete configuration of jBPM runtime using
      Spring XML. That essentially means there are number of factory beans provided as part of
      droolsjbpm-integration module that significanlty simplifies configuration of jBPM. Moreover it
      allows various configuration options such as:</para>

          <para>Removed limitation on custom implementations of work item handler, event listeners
            that had to be placed on global classpath - usually in jbpm-console.war/WEB-INF/lib.
            With that clustom classes can be added as maven dependencies into the project and will
            be registered on underlying components (ksession).</para>
