# CI scripts

Used by [.github/workflows/ci.yaml](../../.github/workflows/ci.yaml).

- [CiComputeBuildScopes.java](CiComputeBuildScopes.java) — figures out which modules a PR actually touches, so CI only builds and tests what's needed instead of the whole reactor.
- [CiSummary.java](CiSummary.java) — turns the build's test results into the human-readable summary you see at the top of a CI run on GitHub.
- [dep-graph-extractor/](dep-graph-extractor/) — Maven extension that writes the the reactor dependency graph. Required by `CiComputeBuildScopes` (and exercised transitively by its tests).

## Developing these scripts

If you change `CiComputeBuildScopes.java` or `CiSummary.java`, run the snapshot tests
locally before pushing — they cover the scenarios under
[tests/scenarios-compute-build-scopes/](tests/scenarios-compute-build-scopes/) and
[tests/scenarios-summary/](tests/scenarios-summary/).

```bash
jbang script/ci/tests/CiComputeBuildScopesTest.java
jbang script/ci/tests/CiSummaryTest.java
```

If a behavior change is intentional, regenerate the goldens by re-running the tests with
`CI_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` — they will rewrite the matching `expected-*.txt` /
`expected-summary.md` files instead of asserting:

```bash
CI_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 jbang script/ci/tests/CiComputeBuildScopesTest.java
CI_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 jbang script/ci/tests/CiSummaryTest.java
```

Review the diff and commit the updated goldens alongside the script change.
