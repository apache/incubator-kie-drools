## RuleAgent configuration file example

#setting this means the rulebase will be created fresh whenever there are 
#changes
newInstance=true

#this points to a binary compiled rule package, you can have spaces
#seperating multiple files
file=/foo/bar/boo.pkg /foo/bar/boo2.pkg

#this specifies that packages may appear in a directory
#it will pick up whatever files are dumped in there (.pkg files like above)
dir=/my/dir

#this specifies a list of urls for packages - these urls 
#are those that are exposed by the BRMS
url=http://some.url/here http://some.url/here

#the following can be used with the urls to keep a local cache
#so if the runtime server is restarted, the BRMS does not need
#to be available
localCacheDir=/foo/bar/cache

#this specifies the frequency at which the sources will be checked for
#changes (in seconds). If you don't set this, it will mean that you have
#to manually poll
poll=30


#this specifies the name of this config, necessary in case logging is used.
