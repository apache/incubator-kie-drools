= {RULE_ENGINE} event listeners and debug logging

The {RULE_ENGINE} generates events when performing activities such as fact insertions and rule executions. If you register event listeners, the {RULE_ENGINE} calls every listener when an activity is performed.

Event listeners have methods that correspond to different types of activities. The {RULE_ENGINE} passes an event object to each method; this object contains information about the specific activity.

Your code can implement custom event listeners and you can also add and remove registered event listeners. In this way, your code can be notified of {RULE_ENGINE} activity, and you can separate logging and auditing work from the core of your application.

The {RULE_ENGINE} supports the following event listeners with the following methods:

.Agenda event listener
[source,java]
----
public interface AgendaEventListener
    extends
    EventListener {
    void matchCreated(MatchCreatedEvent event);
    void matchCancelled(MatchCancelledEvent event);
    void beforeMatchFired(BeforeMatchFiredEvent event);
    void afterMatchFired(AfterMatchFiredEvent event);
    void agendaGroupPopped(AgendaGroupPoppedEvent event);
    void agendaGroupPushed(AgendaGroupPushedEvent event);
    void beforeRuleFlowGroupActivated(RuleFlowGroupActivatedEvent event);
    void afterRuleFlowGroupActivated(RuleFlowGroupActivatedEvent event);
    void beforeRuleFlowGroupDeactivated(RuleFlowGroupDeactivatedEvent event);
    void afterRuleFlowGroupDeactivated(RuleFlowGroupDeactivatedEvent event);
}
----

.Rule runtime event listener
[source,java]
----
public interface RuleRuntimeEventListener extends EventListener {
    void objectInserted(ObjectInsertedEvent event);
    void objectUpdated(ObjectUpdatedEvent event);
    void objectDeleted(ObjectDeletedEvent event);
}
----

For the definitions of event classes, see the https://github.com/kiegroup/drools/tree/{COMMUNITY_VERSION_FINAL}/drools-core/src/main/java/org/drools/core/event[GitHub repository].

//.WorkingMemoryEventManager
//image::UserGuide/WorkingMemoryEventManager.png[align="center"]
//endif::[]

{PRODUCT} includes default implementations of these listeners: `DefaultAgendaEventListener` and `DefaultRuleRuntimeEventListener`. You can extend each of these implementations to monitor specific events.

For example, the following code extends `DefaultAgendaEventListener` to monitor the  `AfterMatchFiredEvent` event and attaches this listener to a KIE session. The code prints pattern matches when rules are executed (fired):

.Example code to monitor and print `AfterMatchFiredEvent` events in the agenda
[source,java]
----
ksession.addEventListener( new DefaultAgendaEventListener() {
   public void afterMatchFired(AfterMatchFiredEvent event) {
       super.afterMatchFired( event );
       System.out.println( event );
   }
});
----

{PRODUCT} also includes the following {RULE_ENGINE} agenda and rule runtime event listeners for debug logging:

* `DebugAgendaEventListener`
* `DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener`

These event listeners implement the same supported event-listener methods and include a debug print statement by default. You can add additional monitoring code for a specific supported event.

For example, the following code uses the `DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener` event listener to monitor and print all working memory (rule runtime) events:

.Example code to monitor and print all working memory events
[source,java]
----
ksession.addEventListener( new DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener() );
